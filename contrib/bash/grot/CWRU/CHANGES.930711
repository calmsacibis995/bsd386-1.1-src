This file details the changes between the previous release of CWRU bash
(5/10/93) and this release.

1. Bugs Fixed

commas within backquotes inside matching braces are now treated as
quoted (e.g., echo {`echo foo:bar | sed s/:/,/`})

don't create the export env unless we are running a command with
shell_execve (in execute_disk_command), and don't create it anew
each time a child is forked

make execute_disk_command look in the temp environment for an
assignment to PATH, and disable hash lookup for the command if
such an assignment is present 

fixed here documents so that backslash-quoted newlines are treated as
Posix.2 specifies

removed a number of extraneous unwind-protects or moved them inside
if statements

only call rl_reset_terminal in sv_term if we're actually using readline

only run traps on SIGCHLD if job_control != 0

fixed readline so it won't try to pass memory allocated with alloca() to
a separate function

cleaned up the readline global function and variable namespace, and split
some more code out from readline.c into separate files

added header files that declare extern functions rather than having those
extern declarations littered throughout the code

readline now allows ^T to be undone

fixed readline so that characters whose screen representation is > 1
character (e.g., \354) are erased correctly

the read builtin no longer attempts to split its input into words if
$IFS is unset

changed the terminating signals that bash catches so they're reset to
their original handlers when a child is forked

the Gnu malloc library code was upgraded to Gnu libc version 1.06

the Gnu termcap library code was upgraded to Gnu termcap version 1.02

the man page was updated to cover the bind -m option

2. New Features

Bash now notices if it's running setuid or setgid and disables $ENV
processing and importing shell functions from the environment

New flag: -p/-o privileged, set if the shell is running setuid or setgid.
Turning this off causes the effective uid and gid to be set to the
real uid and gid

New machine descriptions for the Intel Paragon, Symmetric 375, NeXT 486,
and HP running 4.4 BSD
