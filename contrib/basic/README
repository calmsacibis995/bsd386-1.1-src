Vax-Basic

The files in this directory are:

	Makefile	A makefile for the reconstruction of Vax-Basic.
	basic.l 	Manual page for basic.  Usually installed in
			/usr/man/manl.  At the moment, this is the only
			documentation available for Vax-Basic.  Sorry.
	exec/*.c	The run-time routines for Basic.
	h/*.h		Include files for the source.
	lex/*.c		The lexical analysis routines.
	lines/*.c	The workspace-management routines.
	linpack/*.[fc]	LINPACK routines for matrix inversion and determinants.
	main/*.c	Driver routines.
	misc/*.c	Miscellaneous junk.
	parser/*.[cy]	YACC parser for Basic.
	strings/*.c	Routines that handle the saving of strings.
	symbols/*.c	Symbol-table manager.
	test/*		Basic test programs, including things that have
			syntax and run-time errors.  Some have been taken
			from other places, and haven't been tested yet.
	trees/*.c	Routines that manipulate the parse tree.
	update*		A program to selectively update .h files only
			when the contents of the file changes.  This
			is useful with the -d option of yacc, and keeps
			'make' from remaking everything each time I tweak
			the grammar.


Although support for this beast is not on-going, I will try to help
people if they have problems installing Vax-Basic, or extending it.
I would like to know about bugs, and electronic or US mail is preferable
to phone calls.  Also, if anyone bothers to add file i/o and print-using,
I'd be glad to see it.
