 1000	rem	Gary,
 1010	rem		Notice the strange spacing of
 1020	rem	the last variable when you run this program.
 1030	rem	It is always the last variable that gets the
 1040	rem	strange spacing.  In other words, if you change
 1050	rem	the number of variables read and printed it will
 1070	rem	always be the last variable which is out by itself.
 1080	rem
 1090	read a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l
 1100	print 'read: '; a; b; c; d; e; f; g; h; i; j; k; l;
 1110	data 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
 1120	end
