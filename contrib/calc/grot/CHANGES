Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.27.0 to 2.9.0:

    Full prototypes have been provided for all C functions, and are used
    if calc is compiled with an ANSI compiler.

    Newly defined variables are now initialized to the value of zero instead
    of to the null value.  The elements of new objects are also initialized
    to the value of zero instead of null.

    The gcd, lcm, and ismult functions now work for fractional values.

    A major bug in the // division for fractions with a negative divisor
    was fixed.

    A major bug in the calculation of ln for small values was fixed.

    A major bug in the calculation of the ln and power functions for complex
    numbers was fixed.

    A major lack of precision for sin and tan for small values was fixed.

    A major lack of precision for complex square roots was fixed.

    The "static" keyword has been implemented for variables.  So permanent
    variables can be defined to have either file scope or function scope.

    Initialization of variables during their declaration are now allowed.
    This is most convenient for the initialization of static variables.

    The matrix definition statement can now be used within a declaration
    statement, to immediately define a variable as a matrix.

    Initializations of the elements of matrices are now allowed.  One-
    dimensional matrices may have implicit bounds when initialization is
    used.

    The obj definition statement can now be used within a declaration
    statement, to immediately define a variable as an object.

    Object definitions can be repeated as long as they are exactly the same
    as the previous definition.  This allows the rereading of files which
    happen to define objects.

    The integer, rational, and complex routines have been made into a
    'libcalc.a' library so that they can be used in other programs besides
    the calculator.  The "math.h" include file has been split into three
    include files: "zmath.h", "qmath.h", and "cmath.h".

Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.26.4 to 1.27.0:

    Added an assoc function to return a new type of value called an
    association.  Such values are indexed by one or more arbitrary values.
    They are stored in a hash table for quick access.

    Added a hash() function which accepts one or more values and returns
    a quickly calculated small non-negative hash value for those values.

Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.26.2 to 1.26.4:

    Misc fixes to Makefiles.

    Misc lint fixes.

    Misc portability fixes.

    Misc typo and working fixes to comments, help files and the man page.

Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.24.7 to 1.26.2:

    There is a new emacs-like command line editing and edit history
    feature.  The old history mechanism has been removed.  The key
    bindings for the new editing commands are slightly configurable
    since they are read in from an initialization file.  This file is
    usually called /usr/lib/calc/bindings, but can be changed by the
    CALCBINDINGS environment variable.  All editing code is
    self-contained in the new files hist.c and hist.h, which can be
    easily extracted and used in other programs.

    Two new library files have been added: chrem.cal and cryrand.cal.
    The first of these solves the chinese remainder problem for a set
    of modulos and remainders.  The second of these implements several
    very good random number generators for large numbers.

    A small bug which allowed division by zero was fixed.

    A major bug in the mattrans function was fixed.

    A major bug in the acos function for negative arguments was fixed.

    A major bug in the strprintf function when objects were being printed
    was fixed.

    A small bug in the library file regress.cal was fixed.
