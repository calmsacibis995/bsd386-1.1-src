# Arbitrary precision calculator.

I am allowing this calculator to be freely distributed for personal uses.
Like all multi-precision programs, you should not depend absolutely on
its results, since bugs in such programs can be insidious and only rarely 
show up.

To build calc:

    1) Look at the makefile, and adjust it to suit your needs.

    2) build some calc documentation:

	(cd help; make full)	<- after this, read the file help/full

    3) build calc:

	make

    4) test calc:

	After you have built calc, you can test it by running calc and 
	giving calc the following input:

	read lib/regress	<- should produce no error messages
	read lib/lucas
	read lib/lucas_chk
	lucas_chk(200)		<- should produce no error messages
	exit

If you find bugs, or better yet have bug fixes; or if you have suggested
changes, or better yet have patches, send them to both myself and DBell:

    dbell@canb.auug.org.au
    chongo@toad.com		    {uunet,pyramid,sun}!hoptoad!chongo

The file doc/todo section points out some needs for calc.  Suggestions
on other enhancements, and help in doing these are welcome.
