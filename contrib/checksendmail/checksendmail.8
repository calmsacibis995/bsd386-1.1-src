.Sh NAME
.Nm checksendmail 
.Nd verify sendmail address transformations.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm checksendmail 
.Op Fl C Ar file.cf
.Op Fl r Ar resolve
.Op Fl T Ar test.address
.Op Fl b Ar sendmail_binary
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The 
.Nm checksendmail
program is a 
.Xr perl
script that aids the testing of 
.Xr sendmail 8 's 
various configuration files.
.Nm checksendmail 
passes typical addresses (supplied in input files) through
.Xr sendmail
and prints the results of the resolution and transformation routines.
.Pp
The input files contain a list of addresses, one per line.  
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
user
user@site
user@site.com
.Ed
.Pp
The input file can contain comments started with a 
.Em # 
and blank lines.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact -offset left
.It Fl C Ar file.cf
Use the 
.Xr sendmail
configuration file 
.Ar file.cf
instead of the default 
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cf
file.
.It Fl r Ar resolve
Use
.Ar resolve
as the input file for the addresses to be used for mail resolving.  Defaults
to
.Ar address.resolve .
.It Fl T Ar test.address
Use
.Ar test.address
as the single address to test.  Cannot be used in conjunction with
file setting flags.
.It Fl B Ar sendmail_binary
Use the specified
.Ar sendmail_binary
as the path to invoke sendmail (instead of 
.Pa /usr/sbin/sendmail ) .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
The following command will pass the addresses in 
.Ar address.resolve
through 
.Xr sendmail 
using the configuration information in 
.Ar myconfig.cf .  
.Bd -literal -offset left
example% cat address.resolve
user
user@site
user@site.com
example% checksendmail \-C myconfig.cf
config file: myconfig.cf	resolve file: address.resolve
towhom file: address.resolve	fromwhom file: address.resolve
Mail address resolution
user                        --(ether )-->  user[rmtc]
user@site                   --(ether )-->  user@site[rmtc]
user@site.com               --(ether )-->  user@site.com[rmtc]
`To' address transformations for mailer ether:
user                        ---->  user
user@site                   ---->  user@site
user@site.com               ---->  user@site.com
`From' address transformations for mailer ether:
user                        ---->  user
user@site                   ---->  user
user@site.com               ---->  user
.Ed
.Pp
The first section of the output shows how the addresses in the input
files are resolved by 
.Xr sendmail 8 .
Consider the following output line:
.Pp
.Dl user@site.com	--(ether )-->  user@site.com[rmtc]
.Pp
The input address 
.Em user@site.com
resolves to use the 
.Em ether
mailer.  That mailer is directed to send the mail to
to the user 
.Em user@site.com
at site 
.Em rmtc
(as indicated in the square brackets).
.Pp
The two later sections of output show how the addresses specified as
the 
.Em To 
and 
.Em From 
address are transformed in the text of the
headers.  In the example above, the 
.Em To 
addresses are untouched.
The 
.Em From 
addresses, however, all lose their machine information on
the way through the mailer:
.Pp
.Dl user@site		---->  user
.Pp
This may be desirable when using a configuration file on a
workstation which is to be hidden as a mailhost from the rest of the
network.
.Pp
The following is a set of addresses used at one site for the purposes of
testing address resolution.  Comments after the addresses detail why
particular addresses are present:
.Bl -tag -width "user@machine.com" -compact -offset indent
.It user
Standard trivial address
.It user@rmtc
qualified at one level
.It user@rmtc.central
qualified at two levels
.It user@rmtc.central.sun.com
qualified all the way
.It rmtc!user
local but specified as uucp
.It user@summit
a workstation (normally delivered locally, though)
.It user@summit.central
same but more qualified
.It user@summit.central.sun.com
same but fully qualified
.It summit!user
same but specified as uucp
.It user@prisma
Backward compatibility tests
.It user@prisma.com
.It prisma!user
.It user@central
Superior domain testing
.It user@machine.central
more qualified, but unknown
.It user@summit.central
more qualified and known
.It user@eng
name in faraway domain
.It user@machine.eng
unknown machine in faraway domain
.It user@summit.eng
local machine, far away domain
.It user@hoback
far away machine
.It user@machine
apparently local but unknown machine
.It user@sun.com
Standard trivial address
.It user@machine.dom.sun.com
fully qualified but unknown machine
.It user@foo.com
standard, known, really far away domain 
.It user@foo.dom
standard, unknown, really far away domain
.It site!user
Single level uucp
.It site1!site2!user
Double level uucp
.It user@foo.dom@bar.dom
Trickier address
.It site!user@foo.dom
Mixed uucp/domain
.It site!user@uunet.uu.net
Mixed double uucp/domain

.Sh NOTES
Note that 
.Nm checksendmail
is a 
.Xr perl 
script.  If your site does not have
.Xr perl 1 ,
it can be obtained via anonymous
.Xr ftp
from 
.Em ftp.uu.net .
.Pp
.Xr sendmail
requires that the user have access to directory specified by the 
.Em OQ
parameter in the configuration file (normally 
.Pa /usr/spool/mqueue ) .
.Nm checksendmail
verifies that the user has access to this directory before allowing the 
test to continue.
