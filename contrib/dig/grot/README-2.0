Greetings.

You are the proud owner of 'dig' Version 2.0; a command-line tool
for querying Domain Name System servers.  With proper care and
treatment, you will be able to enjoy your digger for many years
to come.

For those familiar with version 1.0, among the additions and
modifications you'll find:

   o support for zone transfer queries/responses
   o convenient form for address lookups (i.e. "dig -x 129.1.1.2")
   o coredump on large pkt problem fixed
   o man pages reformatted
   o various bugs fixes
   o several minor changes to output format


The files in this distribution are:

COMPILING DIG
=============

As is, 'dig' currently compiles without modification in several
sun3, sparc, vax, microvax, & RT environments.   When initially
attempting other environments, several #include files were found
to be non-existent and/or misplaced on the various systems.  These
files (arpa/nameser.h, sys/param.h, netdb.h, resolv.h) have been
included with this distribution and are included in 'dig' through the
#define statements in the file "hfiles.h".  If 'dig' or the resolver
library does not compile "as-is" (or if you want to include your more
up to date files) you can simply change the #define's in "hfiles.h".


If problems arise when porting to other architectures, often the
only problem is that your machine is not among those listed in the
#if defined() statements in the definition of the HEADER structure
in the file "nameser.h".  Including your own nameser.h file (see note
above) or defining your machine as appropriate should take care of
this.

Dig may be compiled with you own resolver library (if it was compiled
-DDEBUG), but expect the following changes:

	o RTT and packet count stats are not printed
	o different output format (closer to nslookup)
	o print options are meaningless

If you are going to compile using your own resolver you must set the
"-DRESLOCAL" flag (the Makefile also understands "make dig.local").


Dig will also work in environments that are not currently running
the Domain Name System. This may be useful while bringing up the
system. However, this may require slight adjustments or impose
certain constraints ... from the man pages:

	(NOTE: If the server to query is specified by its domain
	name, this name will be resolved using the domain name system
	resolver. If your system does not support DNS, you may *have*
	specify a dot-notation address. Alternatively, if there is
	a server at your disposal somewhere, all that is required
	is that /etc/resolv.conf be present and indicate where the
	default name servers reside, so that server_name itself can
	be resolved. See man resolver(5) for /etc/resolv.conf
	information. Also, the user may set the environment variable
	LOCALRES to name a file which is to be used instead of 
	/etc/resolv.conf. If this variable is not set or the file
	is not readable then /etc/resolv.conf will be used.)


If you prefer, 'dig' has already been compiled for the sun3, vax, and
sparc architectures, and are also available via anonymous ftp from
venera.isi.edu in files:
			   pub/dig-obj.sparc.tar.Z
			   pub/dig-obj.vax.tar.Z
			   pub/dig-obj.sun3.tar.Z

In each of the above files you will find the appropriate resolver
library (libresolv.a) and an object version of `dig`.

Thanks go to the many folks with comments and suggestions
about earlier versions.  Particular thanks to Andrew Cherenson
(arc@sgi.com) for finding and fixing several details (including
revamping of the man page).

Comments and suggestions (gripes & bug reports ;^) are welcome.
