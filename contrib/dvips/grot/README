All real documentation is in the file dvips.tex.  There is also a file
called test.tex that you can read and run to test some basic capabilities of
dvips.  INSTALLATION has the primary installation instructions.

This version of dvips is modified from Tom Rokicki's original in that it
uses the same code for path searching as TeX, the GNU font utilities,
and my modified xdvi.  If you find it useful, you might want to send
mail to Tom suggesting that he merge my changes into the main release.

I also changed the configuration process to use a GNU-style `configure'
script to guess system-dependent information, instead of requiring the
installer to do this in the Makefile.

The one real loss is that %-specifiers no longer work.  I intend to
implement them eventually.  The directory organizations I prefer don't
need them, as you might guess.  (I put each typeface in its own
directory, with all TFM's, VF's, and PK's combined, not separating out
different resolutions.)

As distributed, installing this package will create various executables
in /usr/local/bin, and the corresponding man pages in
/usr/local/man/man1.  It will also create /usr/local/lib/tex/dvips for
the PostScript prologue and other header files, and
/usr/local/lib/tex/macros/dvips for the (La)TeX style files which work
with dvips.

Bugs should probably be reported to me, rather than Tom, so he is not
bothered with bugs that aren't in his program.
