This file describes major changes made to the Elm source distribution
between Releases 2.3 and 2.4.  Please remember that Elm is a volunteer
project, we did what we had time for, and perhaps, what interested us.
If you have a suggestion, or a fix, submit it, and better yet,
volunteer to implement it.

Drop all routing options and let the smart Mail Transport Agent route mail.

Completely new alias subsystem.

Support for NLS, LOCALE and message catalogs.

Quoted string support to allow for X.400 type addresses.

Support for MIME via metamail

Support for Content-Length and Content-type

Enhanced Configure Script

Added -f flag to filter for alternate rules file

Add sender to filter

implements a -q flag to filter to quiet any logging of filtering actions.

More intelligent make install target include better support for man pages

User definable Options Screen

System Wide Elmrc File (Allows binary distribution of Elm)

implement a ucb mail like metoo option in elm.

Split the common routines to a lib directory

Allow using ~ for home directory in filter rules file

Changed save_message to fork/setgid in order to save
message with user's group id instead of mail group id.

Change filter command to not look at $MAIL as it may be
run from sendmail on some systems and $MAIL is set from the
environment of the sender of the mail.  Result was delivery
of mail to the mailbox of the author of the mail instead of
the intended user.

new locking method - allow both fcntl and flock in Filter and Elm

Detect when there are too many filter rules and exit gracefully.

Reimplemented readmsg utility.  Obsoleted "readmsg_file" and
introduced "temp_state" file and "ELMSTATE" environment parameter.
This allows readmsg to understand the current 'sorted' order of the
Elm display, when run while Elm is running.
 
Change date parsing, now uses Numeric TZ and sorting is now TZ aware.

Add resize support, only at the top level, and no minimum size enforcement.

add an option, -i, to use the mentioned file as an inclusion, i.e. the
edit session starts out with that file as its text.   Allows Elm to be
used as a mailer from news readers.

Change in method of reading/writing files to allow for nulls in the
file and better catching of errors on writes such as file system full.

Add ti/te framing for Sun console

add change to folder based on alias (where messages to that folder would
be stored)

allow the user to save to the 'most-recently-used-folder'

Disable stop processing while writing back spool to avoid
stop causing a corrupted/long locked spool file

Changes to allow clearing the weed-out list yet not totally
invalidating all the existing elmrc files.

Add - to allow fastmail to read from stdin

Make frm's exit status more meaningful, add much new functionality,
including the ability to recognize when a message is old, new, or
unread, and when mail is really "To" somebody else.

Change newmail to not keep files open to prevent systems with read
locks from appending to the file.  Add print_prefix to force printing
the prefix if specified and only one folder being monitored.

And many bug fixes.
