.SH NAME
elvrec - recover the modified version of a file after a crash
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBelvrec\fP [\fIpreservedfile\fP [\fInewfile\fR]]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If you're editing a file when \fIelvis\fP dies, the system crashes, or power fails,
the most recent version of your text will be preserved.
The preserved text is stored in a special directory; it does NOT overwrite
your text file automatically.
.PP
The \fIelvrec\fP program locates the preserved version of a given file,
and writes it over the top of your text file -- or to a new file, if you prefer.
The recovered file will have nearly all of your changes.
.PP
To see a list of all recoverable files, run \fIelvrec\fP with no arguments.
.SH FILES
.IP /var/preserve/p*
The text that was preserved when \fIelvis\fP died.
.IP /var/preserve/Index
A text file which lists the names of all preserved files, and the names
of the /var/preserve/p* files which contain their preserved text.
.SH BUGS
.PP
\fIElvrec\fP is very picky about filenames.
You must tell it to recover the file using exactly the same pathname as
when you were editing it.
The simplest way to do this is to go into the same directory that you were
editing, and invoke \fIelvrec\fP with the same filename as \fIelvis\fP.
If that doesn't work, then try running \fIelvrec\fP with no arguments,
to see exactly which pathname it is using for the desired file.
.ig
.PP
Due to the permissions on the /var/preserve directory, on BSD systems
\fIelvrec\fP must be run as superuser.
This is accomplished by making the \fIelvrec\fP executable be owned by "root"
and setting its "set user id" bit.
..
.PP
If you're editing a nameless buffer when \fIelvis\fP dies, then \fIelvrec\fP
will pretend that the file was named "foo".
