FlexFAX Software "Release" 2.1.0

FlexFAX, Version 2.1.0 (changes since 2.0 beta)
-----------------------------------------------

o the configure script has been extensively reworked; it now is capable of
  reconfiguring the majority of the builtin pathnames and parameters that
  must be specified at compile time
o the configure script now checks what version of C++ is installed on
  an SGI system and sets up the -v2 flag (to get the 2.1 compiler under
  C++ 3.0) as necessary
o a new file MODEMS contains the current wisdom about modems that have
  been tried with this software

Changes in the port tree:
    o the sun4 directory has been renamed sun since both sun3 and sun4
      machines are handled
    o support for BSDi Gamma 4 is now included
    o support for 386bsd 0.1 is now included
    o support for SVR4 on a 386/486 is now included
    o support for Solaris 2.x is now included
    o a new generic directory has been added for "default" portability
      stuff

Changes to faxd:
    o there is a new driver for modems that support the Class 1 programming
      interface (EIA/TIA-578, November 1990)
    o all modem-specific command sequences are now specified by configuration
      parameters in the server's configuration file; see ModemConfig.h and
      config(4F) for details
    o the fax modem driver class hierarchy has been reorganized to move
      more common functionality into the base class and to make all the
      modem drivers more alike
    o there are two new tracing controls: for HDLC frames, and for binary
      I/O (e.g. for Class 1 modems)
    o the use of the "@" symbol in dialing has been parameterized (use the
      ModemDialCmd configuration parameter) and a workaround for the ZyXEL's
      failure to properly implement this is provided (check out the parameter
      NoCarrierRetrys in config(4F))
    o the expected bit order of sent and received facsimile data can now
      be configured independently through the ModemSendFillOrder and
      ModemRecvFillOrder configuration parameters
    o all the modem drivers now correctly renegotiate session parameters
      as required on page boundaries; doing so, however, requires that the
      modem be capable of doing this (certain Class 2 modems are not)
    o the send logic in the modem drivers will not retry the sending of
      a single page more than 3 times (this insures any bugs in the server
      or modem will not cause repeated transmissions)
    o all the modem drivers handle negative acknowledgements with or
      without retraining; unacceptable received page data is overwritten
      with retransmitted data
    o the logic used for doing modem resets is very different and, hopefully,
      more robust
    o the modem initialization strategy will now make use of the ATI4
      query to deduce the set of possible DCE-DTE baud rates (if this
      command is not supported, the driver falls back on the usual
      strategy)
    o it is now possible to supply a "modem type hint" that is used when
      faxd tries to figure out what kind of modem it's working with
    o different send+receive DTE-DCE baud rates are now supported; this
      is important for some modems that lock the receive rate no matter
      what the current rate is
    o the accounting file format has been changed to include more information
      (signalling rate, protocol, reason for failure) and to make it easier
      to parse with awk (all fields are now tab-separated)
    o the TSI qualification mechanism has been extended: pattern files
      are now specified in the configuration file so it's possible, for
      example, to have different modems use different pattern files
    o the server does a better job of dealing with non-USA page sizes
      (hopefully it supports ISO A4, B4, and any other page size that
      can be specified within T.30)
    o many configuration parameters have been removed and/or replaced
      by the new configuration scheme; in particular, UseToneDialing and
      DialPrefix
    o the server now rereads the configuration file if it has changed
      before each time that it configures a modem; this makes it possible,
      for example, to edit the config file and have it noticed the next
      time a send is done
    o POSIX and BSD-style signals are now automatically used if available
    o support for interfacing directly with system getty programs is now
      used in place of the builtin getty emulation
    o support for BSD-style and SVR4-style uucp lock files has been added
    o a bug that resulted in the tty device mode and ownership being
      left set wrong after a System V getty process was invoked has been
      fixed
    o a bug that caused faxd to leave the tty device mode and ownership
      set wrong when it exited has been fixed
    o various uucp lock file-related configuration parameters have been
      moved from util/config.h to the defs file
    o unsent files are now returned to the sender by mail along with a
      copy of the trace log

    o a bug was fixed in the Everex driver that caused the "+" character
      in the CIG to be incorrectly translated
    o some "corner cases" in the Group 3 protocol have been corrected
      in the Everex modem driver
    o the Everex modem driver has an improved training algorithm
    o some code in the Everex driver that caused some versions of gcc to
      dump core has been mangled into an acceptable format

    o the Class 2 driver now works with both XON/XOFF and RTS/CTS flow
      control schemes
    o the Class 2 driver receive code now correctly counts the number
      of lines in a received page
    o the Class 2 driver now correctly sets recvDataTrigger to DC2 for
      Rockwell RC32ACL model modems
    o the tracing of HDLC frames in the Class 2 driver is now controlled by
      the HDLC frame tracing flag (instead of the protocol tracing flag)
    o a problem where the ZyXEL modem drops DCD too quickly has been
      worked around in the Class 2 driver (at least best as can be done)
    o more tracing messages have been added to the Class 2 driver

Changes in the etc directory:
    o a new faxaddmodem shell script does modem setup and configuration
    o there are new prototype configuration files for the Supra v.32bis,
      ZyXEL 1496E, Everex 24/96D, Telebit WorldBlazer, Digicom Scout+,
      Multi-Tech 1432BAI, and Abaton 24/96 modems
    o the skeletal configuration file (config.skel) is all different
      because of its use by the faxaddmodem shell script
    o Class 1 and Class 2-specific skeletal configuration files are used
      instead of config.skel when feasible
    o the faxsetup shell script is no longer used--it's functionality
      has been incorporated into the faxaddmodem script

Changes to faxd.recv:
    o the etc/hosts file is now treated as a set of regular expression
      patterns that are matched against the incoming host and user id
    o a new checkPerm command was added to the protocol so that clients
      can check send permission before sending data
    o a new kill command was added to the protocol so that clients can
      remove jobs and force unsent data to be returned to the sender
      (this is the mechanism by which jobs that time out are dealt with)
    o a bug was fixed whereby certain error messages were not returned
      to the client before the server prematurely terminated

Changes to sendfax:
    o the type of input files is now deduced through a set of file type
      identification rules; similarly the procedure for converting a file
      to PostScript or TIFF is specified in this file
    o the -A, -B, -L, and -W options have been added for specifying alternate
      page dimensions
    o the -r option has been added for use with faxcover
    o the -v option has changed; one -v causes sendfax to trace local work;
      a second -v option causes the protocol exchanges with faxd.recv to
      be printed on the terminal
    o sendfax is now more careful to do as much work as possible before
      calling the remote server; in particular cover pages are now generated
      before sending anything and sendfax will abort if a requested cover
      page can not be generated
    o a -f option was added so that suitably privileged users can override
      the normal sender's identity (especially useful in building a mail
      to fax gateway)

Changes to faxcover:
    o the system-wide prototype cover page file is now in the directory
      /usr/local/lib/fax (or similar)
    o a -r option was added for setting the "Re:" field in a cover page
      (through the /regarding symbol)
    o the cover page comments field is now broken up by faxcover.ps into
      multiple lines
    o the current date and time is now available for cover pages as
      /todays-date
    o the prototype cover page file is redesigned (thanks to Dave Ratcliffe
      at SGI and to Brent Townshend for the PostScript code to wrap lines);
      if you don't work for SGI you'll want to at least change/remove the
      SGI logo

Changes to faxmail:
    o this program was totally rewritten; it now uses font metrics to
      do page layout
    o information is now included on how to build a simple email to fax
      gateway using faxmail, sendfax, and sendmail.

Changes to fax2ps:
    o the code and code pair tables are now dynamically grown as needed
    o a bug was fixed in the setup of the temp file used when reading
      input from stdin
    o the T.4 decoding code is now more robust in the face of corrupted
      data

Changes in the utility code:
    o overlapped memory copies that were being done with memcpy are now
      correctly done with memmove (ANSI C)
    o the dit2fax and text2fax shell scripts are no longer needed because
      of the new type rule support used by sendfax
    o a new awk script, xferdest.awk, has been added; it process an
      accounting file and prints a summary of fax jobs collected according
      to destination phone number
    o a bug in the FaxClient class that caused client programs such as
      sendfax to prematurely terminate when getting an EPIPE has been fixed
    o the library-specific fxAssert macro now uses its own _fxassert
      function instead of the usual function _assert

Changes to lptops:
    o lptops is now installed in /usr/local/lib/fax to avoid conflicts
      with other versions that may be installed on the system

Changes in the doc directory:
    o class1.txt is a new document from the Supra BBS that describes the
      Class 1 command interface implemented for Rockwell chips
    o class2.txt is a new document from the Supra BBS that describes the
      Class 2 command interface implemented for Rockwell chips
    o hayes.txt is a new document from the Hayes BBS that includes
      interesting tidbits about certain commonly found AT commands
    o Michael Shiels' Class 2 modem scoreboard has been updated
    o suprainfo is a new file that contains info on contact Supra
    o zyxel is a file that has info about ZyXEL modem firmware that used
      to be in the toplevel README file
    o modems-faq is a new document that answers many questions about modems

Changes to the manual pages:
    o on SGI systems preformatted manual pages are installed instead of
      nroff/troff sources
    o the log(4F) man page now has information on messages that may appear
      in the log files (THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE)
