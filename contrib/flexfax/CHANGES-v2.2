FlexFAX Software Release 2.2.0

FlexFAX, Version 2.2.0 (changes since Release 2.1.0)
----------------------------------------------------

General changes:
    o it is now possible to configure a default page size (e.g. ISO A4)
      to use for outgoing facsimile; an external database of page sizes
      makes it easy to define new page sizes and to alter the default;
      programs that need a page size to be specified support a -s option
      for doing this
    o the default vertical resolution to use for outgoing facsimile is
      now configurable at compile time through the configure script
    o local dialing conventions are now specified in a ``dial string rules''
      file that is read by the fax server; these rules define how to craft
      canonical phone numbers from dialing strings and how to process a
      user-supplied dial string before it is presented to the modem
    o private information that must be specified in a dial string (e.g.
      credit card access codes) can be hidden by setting up dial string
      rules for the client applications
    o the lptops utility used in 2.1.0 has been replaced by a new textfmt
      program that is less general, but more integrated with the system
    o the fax server can be commanded to answer an incoming call explicitly
      as fax, data, or voice (though voice has no effect right now)
    o support has been added to the server for two adaptive answering schemes
      that are implemented entirely in the server; the first scheme causes
      the server to answer a call first as fax and then as data; in the second
      scheme the server rotates call answering among a set of techniques
      (data, fax, voice); see the README file and the config(4F) manual page
      for more information
    o at(1) is no longer used for delayed submission and job timeout (the
      server now handles these tasks internally)
    o user notification by the server is now done through shell scripts
    o users may now tag outgoing jobs with an arbitrary identification string
      that is returned in any notification messages
    o more job parameters can be altered after a job is submitted: time-to-send,
      killtime, and max retries.

    o a port to 4.4BSD has been added, consult port/4.4bsd/README
    o a port to Linux has been added, consult port/linux/README
    o a port to AIX 3.2.3 has been added, consult port/aix32/README
    o a port to Ultrix 4.2a has been added, consult port/ultrix/README
    o an unfinished port to HPUX 9.0 has been added, consult port/hpux/README

    o support has been added for the US Robotics Courier Class 1 modem
    o support has been added for the US Robotics Sportster Class 1 modem
    o support has been added for the AT&T DataPort Class 1 modem (including
      a workaround for a bug in the 1.22 firmware)
    o support has been added for the PPI PM14400FXMT and PM14400FXSA modems
    o support has been added for modems based on the Rockwell RCS32ACL

    o Ghostscript 2.6.1 (w/ patches) is now the "approved" PD PostScript
      interpreter to use with the software
    o gcc 2.4.5 and libg++-2.4 are now the "approved" PD compiler suite to use
    o a tree of contributed stuff that doesn't really belong in the mainstream
      distribution has been started--check out the contrib area in the public
      ftp area on the host sgi.com (sgi/fax/contrib)
    o the flexfax mailing list (flexfax@sgi.com) is now managed automatically;
      users should send mail to majordomo@whizzer.wpd.sgi.com (consult the
      README or HOWTO files for full information)

Changes in the "top of the tree":
    o the MODEMS file talks about more modems
    o the README file now identifies which modems are recommended for use
    o configure now builds a port.h file to cover up missing external
      declarations, variables, and #define macros
    o client library information is now installed into configurable LIBDATA
      and LIBEXEC areas; so that machine-independent data files can be shared
      across multiple architectures

Changes in the ghostscript support:
    o several bugs in the tiffg3 driver have been corrected

Changes in the port tree:
    o new 4.4bsd, linux, aix32, and ultrix directories
    o Tim Rylance's streams module for using Class 1 modems on Sun systems
      is included (and faxd has been patched to use it if it is loaded into
      the operating system)
    o all top-level make files are now named Makefile.flexfax
    o all gcc-based ports no longer reference -liberty
    o generic/mkdepend has a workaround for systems with busted shells

Changes to faxd:
    o it is now permissible for 2D encoded data to be sent to a fax machine
      that has not previously been called
    o the fax machine information database has been extended to permit
      individual machines to be ``disabled'' with any submitted jobs returned
      to sender w/ a machine-specific rejection notice
    o the ModemType configuration parameter is no longer treated as a hint;
      the modem will not be probed as any other kind if the type is specified
      to be ``Class1'', ``Class2'', or ``Everex''/``Abaton''; the old behaviour
      can be obtained by not specifying a ModemType or by specifying the type
      as ``Unknown''
    o there are new configuration parameters for responding to explicit
      requests to answer an incoming call as fax, data, or voice; there
      are Modem*AnswerCmd parameters and ModemAnswer*Begin parameters for
      forcing actions such as baud rate change on answer
    o the total number of phone calls placed for an outgoing job can now be
      controlled
    o dial string handling is now defined by an external set of rules
    o a workaround was added for systems where opening FIFO files read-only
      causes problems (SCO ODT 2.0, AIX 3.2.3, Ultrix 4.2A)
    o the notification done for received facsimile now contains all available
      information (most importantly any error that occurred)
    o the server now correctly handles renegotiation of session parameters
      due to variations in the input data; it used to violate the T.30
      protocol by requesting parameter renegotiation without notifying the
      remote side through the end-of-page message
    o the server now correctly identifies when a remote site has documents
      available for polled retrieval (it previously always assumed there
      were documents available)
    o the server now invokes the bin/pollrcvd script to deliver each document
      received during a poll
    o the server now invokes the bin/faxrcvd script for each received facsimile
    o the server now invokes the bin/notify script for user notification (such
      as when a job is requeued)
    o the server now records the remote CSI in the info/* files
    o the data in the info directory is now partitioned strictly between
      cached data (kept in the info directory) and static data (kept in the
      new cinfo directory)
    o it is now possible to configure a per-machine session tracing level
      by creating an entry in the cinfo directory
    o the session logging facility now supports the syslog-style %m format
      for recording system call errors
    o AT command strings may now include escape codes to force the server to
      reconfigure the baud rate and/or flow control scheme at any time that
      a configurable command is transmitted to a modem
    o the baud rate hunting logic has been removed; host-modem communication
      is now locked at a fixed baud rate (except when changed by escape codes)
    o getty processes are now reaped immediately by catching SIGCLD instead
      of polling for process exit
    o support has been added for modems that send "FAX" or "DATA" before
      "CONNECT" when answering an inbound call
    o the server no longer loses memory when receiving facsimile
    o the protection mode set by the server is now configurable
    o the server automatically uses the zsunbuf stream i/o module on Sun
      systems if it has been configured in the kernel
    o a mistake in the calculation of the random backoff interval when
      requeuing a job has been corrected
    o the accounting information has been expanded

    [Class 1]

    o a bug has been fixed in the Class 1 driver for modems that have
      different xmit and recv capabilities--the recv capabilities were
      being used to decide the best signalling rate at which to xmit
    o the Class 1 driver now accepts ASCII data in received TSI/CIG string
    o the Class 1 driver receive frame abort logic has been extended to
      support modems that do not respond well to the usual resynchronization
      scheme
    o the Class 1 driver timeout on receiving the initial identification
      frames can now be configured separately for use with the adaptive answer
      scheme implemented in the server
    o the Class 1 driver no longer assumes that a "CONNECT" response to an
      answer command implies a fax connection--instead the connection type
      is selected according to the answering request
    o a bug has been fixed in the Class 1 driver that caused spurious error
      messages to be returned when answering an incoming call
    o the Class 1 driver now properly formulates the min scanline time
      parameter in the DCS for all times
    o the Class 1 driver is now more careful to avoid looping if the remote
      side prematurely drops carrier
    o HDLC frame handling has been parameterized to deal with modems that
      do not include the FCS bytes in received frames (e.g. the AT&T DataPort)
    o a bug has been fixed in the Class 1 driver that caused a failure
      message to be recorded for successfully received facsimile
    o the Class 1 driver will no longer loop if the modem drops carrier w/o
      notifying the host when waiting for DCN in Class1Modem::recvEnd (as
      done by the USR Courier)
    o a bug was fixed in the Class 1 driver's xmit protocol (a DIS response
      to sending training was not correctly handled)
    o the Class 1 driver now only tries to send training 3 times (per the spec)
    o the Class 1 driver now correctly specifies 7200bps v.17 in the DCS

    [Class 2]

    o typos in the Class 2 error message table were fixed
    o the Class 2 driver now ignores suprious modem status msgs when sending
    o the Class 2 driver is now more careful about receiving invalid +FDCS
      and +FDIS result strings from the modem
    o the Class 2 driver now generates fully specified +FDCC and +FDIS commands
      to workaround firmware bugs in some modems (defaulted parameters are
      incorrectly treated as 0 on PPI modems and others)
    o ZyXEL modems with rev 6.01 or newer firmware are now permitted to
      send high res (196lpi) and 2D-encoded data
    o PPI modems with rev 2.17 or older firmware are not permitted to send
      high res (196lpi) or 2D-encoded data 'cuz of firmware problems

Changes to faxaddmodem:
    o a different algorithm is used for identifying Class 1 modems;
      the product code returned by ATI0 is now used
    o there no longer is a builtin notion of what modems have prototype
      configuration files; config files are now searched for in the etc
      subdirectory of the spooling area
    o faxaddmodem is no longer is fooled by the installation of other
      fax packages that have a similar /etc/services entry
    o certain alternative locations for system files are now handled
      transparently
    o a better job is done identifying if Yellow Pages/NIS is in use
    o the fax number no longer must be specified in a fixed format
    o various portability problems have been worked around

Changes to sendfax:
    o has been rewritten to use a new SendFaxClient class that encapsulates
      the real work done in submitting a job
    o updated to handle different page sizes
    o has a new -t option to set the number of times a job should be ``tried''
      (i.e. the phone should be dialed)
    o has a new -i option to specify a job identification tag
    o a bug that caused fully qualified from addresses to not work has been
      corrected
    o local dial string rules may be applied to the user-specified dial
      strings to create ``displayable'' phone numbers that do not include
      private information such as credit card access codes

Changes to faxalter:
    o has a new -t option to specify the max number of tries
    o has a new -k option to specify the killtime for a job

Changes to faxcover:
    o updated to handle different page sizes
    o if a FAXCOVER environment variable is set, it's value is used as the
      pathname of the template file

Changes to faxmail:
    o updated to handle different page sizes
    o now looks for AFM files with a .afm suffix (for folks with
      OpenWindows AFM files)
    o a mailfax script for smail has been added

Changes to fax2ps:
    o no changes

Changes to sgi2fax:
    o updated to handle different page sizes

Changes to faxstat:
    o now uses the page size database to determine page size information
      for facsimile in the receive queue

Changes in the utility code:
    o two bugs have been fixed in the FaxClient class's handling of the
      GECOS field in the password file
    o new classes were added for: accessing the page size database
      (PageSize.c++), for sending facsimile (SendFaxClient.c++), and for
      accessing the rule typing database used in converting documents for
      transmission (TypeRules.c++)
    o a new program, textfmt, replaces the lptops program
    o a bug was fixed in the fxStr class where inserting into the start of
      a null string caused problems
    o a new %s escape was added to the typerules support for passing the
      symbolic page size name to filter programs
    o faxanswer now takes a -h option to specify how to answer an incoming
      call (``fax'', ``data'', and ``voice'' strings are recognized)
    o faxinfo now uses the page size database to print out page size names
    o notify.sh has been renamed faxrcvd.sh and changed to take more
      arguments and pass the additional information on to the FaxMaster user
    o notify.sh is now the script invoked to send notification mail to a user
    o rts.sh has been subsumed by notify.sh
    o a new file, pagesizes, is a database of recognized page sizes
    o a new file pollrcvd.sh is a command script invoked to deliver each

    o faxsubmit is no longer needed
    o submit2at is no longer needed
    o probemodem.sh is a new shell script that probes a modem and reports
      responses to certain Class 1 and Class 2 commands; it is useful to
      see how closely a modem conforms to the Class 1/2 specifications
      that flexfax assumes
    o xferstats.sh is a shell script for processing accounting information
      for transmitted facsimile
    o recvstats.sh is a shell script for processing accounting information
      for received facsimile

Changes to faxd.recv:
    o the code that reads job description files is now more careful to
      ignore corrupted or partially written files
    o the main command parser was rewritten
    o support was added for the alteration of more job parameters
    o the root user is now treated like the fax user (i.e. it is permitted
      to do privileged operations)

Changes in the InterViews code:
    o the Regexp class has been extended to provide access to the pattern
      string
    o the regexp code has been changed to recognize "\(\)" instead of "()"
      for identifying substrings in matches
    o the dispatcher code is now capable of waiting on the termination
      (actually change in status) of one or more child processes
