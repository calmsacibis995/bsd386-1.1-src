[It would be really useful to me if I could find out what modems are
 being used and on what platforms.  If you use or have used the
 software, please fill out the form below and return it to the above
 address. If you have multiple copies or multiple different systems,
 it would be easiest for me if you sent me one form for each system
 (I'll be processing the forms automatically, so please don't change
 the text to the left of a ":").  This information is solely for my use.]
