# This directory contains Adobe font metric files for the most
# common PostScript fonts.  They were obtained from the dvips
# distribution that is available on ftp.uu.net (use

#
# to locate them).  Note the copyright on them.  Note that the
# lptops program expects them to reside in files without a ".afm"
# suffix.
