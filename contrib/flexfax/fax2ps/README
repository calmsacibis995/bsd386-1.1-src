This directory contains a program for converting TIFF fax files
to a highly encoded PostScript for printing.  In point of fact,
the program can actually handle bilevel TIFF images compressed
with the CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 algorithms.  The resultant
PostScript is usually much more efficient to print than the
straightforward "raster dump" generated by tiff2ps.

Consult the manual page for details.
