#   mailfax - email to fax gateway for smail3.1.
#
#   This file should be installed as /usr/local/bin/mailfax, and the
#   following changes made to the smail configuration:
#
#   Add the following to /usr/local/lib/smail/transports:
#       fax: driver=pipe, local;
#           pipe_as_sender, cmd="/usr/local/bin/mailfax"
#
#   Add the following to /usr/local/lib/smail/routers:
#       fax: driver=queryprogram, transport=fax;
#           cmd="/usr/bin/expr ${lc:host} : '.*\.fax$'"
#
#   If you do not already have a routers file, you *must* create one
#   with the default routing info, included below:
#       inet_addrs: driver=gethostbyaddr, transport=smtp;
#           fail_if_error, check_for_local,
#       inet_hosts: driver=gethostbyname, transport=smtp;
#           -required, -domain, -only_local_domain,
#       paths: driver=pathalias, transport=uux;
#           file=paths, proto=bsearch, optional, -required, domain=uucp,
#       uucp_neighbors: driver=uuname, transport=uux;
#           cmd=/usr/bin/uuname, domain=uucp,
#       smart_host: driver=smarthost, transport=uux;
#           -path,
#
#   Note: I'm not a smail expert; this file is the result of a couple
#       of hours of experimentation.                 Rick Lyons.
