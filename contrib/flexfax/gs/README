This directory holds a device driver for version 2.6.1 of Ghostscript
that write TIFF Class F format files.  It's possible to convert this to
work with earlier versions of Ghostscript, but there's little
point--just update to a newer version.  The driver included in this
distribution is either identical to the version provided with Ghoscript
or slightly newer.  You can use either driver, though you are likely to
find that the version in this directory has some bugs fixed.

Configure the tiffg3 device by following the directions supplied with
the Ghostscript distribution; this basically requires that you add
"tiffg3.dev" to the list of configured devices and then rebuild
Ghostscript.

Note that if you use Ghostscript to image PostScript in the fax server
then you must specify "gs" for the PostScript imager when you run the
configure script.

Beware that the Ghostscript driver does not support 2D encoding.  This
is known by the ps2fax.gs.sh script that invokes it (it strips out the
1-D/2-D options supplied by the fax server).
