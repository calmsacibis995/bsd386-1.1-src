Start of README
---------------

The port to 386bsd is still far from perfect, but at least it is
possible to send and receive faxes. If you have problems with it
(other than described below) or have fixes to it I would appreciate if
you e-mail me

Here's some of tricks to get it running
----------------------------------------

This has been tested on 386BSD using gcc-2.4.5. If you compile it with
gcc-2.3.3 look at the gcc fix in the sun directory.

The only make that works with the makefiles is GNU make-3.63 and
newer, with standard /usr/bin/make (from distribution) you will get
nowhere.  Also with GNU make-3.62 you will have problems with
incdepend targets.

I used the libg++-2.4 library and ghostscript-2.6.1.

The distribution /bin/sh does not handle many of the scripts, install
bash as /bin/bash.

The distribution expr does not handle the faxaddmodem script, replace
with expr from GNU shellutils.

The distribution sed does not handle the faxaddmodem script, replace
/usr/bin/sed with GNU sed.

There is no ed in standard distribution, you can get good ed
from netcom.com:pub/alm.

I think I had problems with /bin/test, a new BSD version is available
from ftp.uu.net:/packages/bsd-sources/bin/test. With this version
there are no problems (the problems might be very hard to detect,
so you better just get the new sources and drop them in to
/usr/src/bin/test, do ./mkops in that directory before recompiling.

The kernel needs to be recompiled with "options FIFO" in the config
file. Before running config on your new config file you have to
remove fifo.h and all *.o files in your compile directory, the cause
of the troubles is not known in detail... At the time of of patchkit
2.1 there are also bugs in the fifo routines in the kernel, look at
the news archives at sunvis.rtpnc.epa.gov for FIFO related articles.

The include file /usr/include/stdio.h has a bug. It uses an inline
function __sgetc() that should be compiled only when:
#if defined(__GNUC__) && defined(__STDC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
now the __STRICT_ANSI__ part is missing.

I have successfully sent and received faxes with my Supra FAXmodem
v32bis.
