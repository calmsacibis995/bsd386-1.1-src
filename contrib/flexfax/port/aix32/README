This directory contains the files needed to port the FlexFax fax server to
the IBM RISC System/6000.  The environment under which this port was made
was:

	RISC System/6000 model 580
	AIX 3.2.3 extended
	gcc v2.4.5 with g++ libraries v2.3.1

I have tried to compile with libg++ v2.4 but without success.

There are several directories under this port directory.  The
gcc-related directory contains wrappers for system headers for use by gcc
during comilation of C++ code.  The redefinition of certain system functions
in unistd.h is intentional and avoids problems with prototyping under C++.
