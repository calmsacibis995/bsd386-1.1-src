These comments pertain to version 1.0 of BSDi.

You will need to obtain the following from your local source archive site:
	gcc 2.3.3 or later, and a compatible libg++
	GNU make
	ghostscript 2.5.2 or later (2.5.2 is provided in 1.0)

First step is to obtain the above, compile and install.
See gs/README for instructions on how to add the "tiffhigh" and "tifflow"
devices to Ghostscript.

Next, you will have to modify your kernel configuration, to add the following:

	options	FIFO

The "FIFO" option causes support for named pipes in the filesystem.
Without "FIFO" being enabled, FlexFax will not function.

Rebuild your kernel (see "Rebuilding Your Kernel" on page 38 of the Revision
1.0 release notes) and reboot from the new version.

cd to the FlexFax source directory.

Run ./configure.

Make sure that all the paths, etc, are correct, and that the UUCP lock
type is binary.

as root, running bash, issue:

	# ulimit -s unlimited
	# ulimit -m unlimited
	# ulimit -d unlimited
	# gmake

The `ulimit's are necessary to compile libtiff/tif_fax3.c, since it includes
the libtiff/g3states.h include file, which is humungous.

faxaddmodem requires /bin/bash, rather than sh.  To invoke it, use

	# bash ./faxaddmodem.sh -os BSDi -s 38400


I run FlexFax with a ZyXEL internal modem, running UUCP on the
same port as faxes.  The GettyBSD.c++ file enables this, by exec()ing
/usr/libexec/getty when a data call comes in.
I run getty at a fixed rate of 38400, using the "hw.38400" entry in the
gettytab.

hw.38400:\
	:to=30:tc=38400-baud:

Prior to invoking login, getty resets the port to the "default" setting.
I run the modem in a manner which requires "clocal" be turned on in order
to talk to it.  Faxd turns on "clocal".  When login runs, I want "clocal"
off.  Thus, the "default" settings for the modem are set so that "clocal"
is turned of.  This causes SIGHUP to be sent to the session when the
modem drops carrier.

I have the following in /etc/rc.local to setup the "default" settings.

stty -f /dev/tty02 -D cts_oflow rts_iflow 38400 cs8 -parenb -istrip -clocal


Problems:
	ZyXEL modem is buggy.  Fax reception often renders garbage.
