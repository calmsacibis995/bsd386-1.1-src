Start of README
---------------

 The FreeBSD port is basically the same as the 386BSD port. But as
FreeBSD comes with updated binaries and gcc there are a few changes.
 Besides getting the flexFAX software you also need ghostscript, bash,
and GNU make.
 The easiest way to install software packages on FreeBSD is with
pkg_install. The pkg_install sorces and binary packages of many
packages are available from freebsd.cdrom.com:pub/FreeBSD/packages.

Here's some of tricks to get it running
----------------------------------------

 The only make that works with the makefiles is GNU make-3.63 or newer,
with standard /usr/bin/make (from distribution) you will get nowhere.
Also with GNU make-3.62 you will have problems with incdepend
targets.

 The kernel needs to be recompiled with "options FIFO" in the config
file. With FreeBSD 1.0 GAMMA and earlier you must start with a fresh
compile directory for the kernel, i.e. rm -rf /sys/compile/<kernel>
before config <kernel>. In FreeBSD 1.0 EPSILON and later this problem
has been fixed

 I have successfully sent and received faxes with my Supra FAXmodem
v32bis. The getty with SunOS GettyArgs also works.

 When running faxaddmodem use a tty* name, e.g. tty00, *not* sio, or
anything else. The major and minor numbers of tty* is the same as for
sio*. You might see some syslog and warning messages when running
faxaddmodem, they are:

1. FIFO.tty01: open: Device not configured
   This happens on the two first tries of faxaddmodem and sequent runs of it
   does not complain. After this all FIFO communication seems to work fine.

2. A number of:
     stty: stdout appears redirected, but stdin is the control descriptor
   These are warnings from FreeBSD's stty, and seem harmless. They occur
   because the script is not using the "stty -f /dev/tty* ..." syntax.
