The kernel needs a small bugfix - see the file kernel.patch for details.
This must be applied for all kernels <= pl12.  pl9 and pl10 (and maybe
pl11) will patch cleanly (with offset lines warnings), but pl12 will
have to be patched by hand.  I'm still at pl9 myself, so haven't tested
the patch with pl10-12, but feedback I've received indicates that these
kernels work correctly after patching.  To install the patch, execute
the following from the directory in which this file resides:
	(cd /linux ; patch -p0) < kernel.patch

If you intend sharing the serial port with other programs (uucp, kermit,
minicom, etc) make sure that the port you supply to faxaddmodem is the
same as that used by the other programs.  If you want to allow remote
logins and you are using the cua* devices, you will need to run getty
with the corresponding ttyS* device.  This is because the cua* devices
differ in some signal handling respects to the ttyS* devices, and the
login process suffers.  My config.cua1 has the line:
	GettyArgs:	"-h ttyS1 %s vt100"

If you are using the RINGBACK feature in getty_ps to allow your phone to
be used for both voice and data calls, be aware that the standard
FlexFax distribution does not yet support this feature.  I have a patch
that supplies a workaround; contact me for details.

I've built this successfully with make 3.62, gcc 2.3.3, 99p9, and have
received +ve results from users with gcc 2.4.5, 99p12.

If you are using gcc 2.3.3, the tiff library will require at least
15Mb (RAM + SWAP) and a significant amount of time to compile.  If
you have the source handy, see the file port/generic/GCC-PATCH.

Problems to pclink@qus102.qld.tne.oz.au or rick@razorback.brisnet.org.au.

Rick.
