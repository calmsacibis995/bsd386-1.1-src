# Loader flags, composed of library (-l's) and option parts, with

# other "direction" from CFLAGS so that all the -L's, that are part of
# LDOPTS, appear before any of the -l's, which are part of LDLIBS.
# Another benefit of segregating the libraries from the remaining of the
# loader options is that the libraries alone can easily be given to
# another program, e.g., lint.
