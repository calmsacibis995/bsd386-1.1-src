From "Daniel I. Rosenblatt" <dir@csn.org>:

Stuff to make sure you check:
	- all configurable pathnames (my setup is pretty bizarre)
	- gcc has '-pipe' which is non-standard for gcc built on SCO UNIX
		(I used gas 2.0 to enable this option)
	- bin/notify calls sendmail, which is NOT configured by default
		on SCO UNIX
	- /etc/init.d/faxd is sym-linked to /etc/rc2.d/S80faxd ...,
		the modes on the sym-link fool the startup code into
		executing the scripts even if the scripts themselves
		aren't executable
	- faxd/modem sometimes seem to hang waiting for each other; I
		haven't looked into this one yet
	- incoming faxes are completely garbled/severely truncated; I
		haven't figured out why yet

Other random notes:
	- my OS is SCO ODT 2.0; your mileage may vary
	- gcc is 2.3.3, libg++ is 2.3, gas is 2.0, ld is from binutils-2.1
	- I've got a SupraFAXModem Rev V1.70B-03, not what sam@sgi.com
		used (V1.200-H); this might explain the next note and the
		problem with incoming faxes being trashed
	- with my version of the SupraFAXModem, I have to disable adaptive
		answering when dialing out, i.e.:
			ModemDialCmd +FAA=0DT%s@
		if I don't, I get a data connection instead of a fax
		connection when dialing another fax-modem to send a fax
