The port described here works on a decstation 5000/240 with ultrix 4.2A.
Though not extensively tested, I've verified sending and reception from various
faxmachines. I'm also sending from  other clients on my network through this
server (suns, Indigos).

The modem I use is ZyXEL 1496E+, rom revision 6.01


Preliminaries
-------------
First of all you need to install/replace the following.
[Believe me; you'll get nowhere with the standard versions of sed,expr,etc.]

These are my known good versions.

 * gcc-2.4.5
 * libg++-2.4
 * gnu make-3.67
 * gs-2.6.1 (with 4 additional patches)
 * install gnu bash as /bin/bash		(version 1.12)
 * replace /bin/sed with gnu sed		(version 1.18)
 * replace /bin/expr from gnu shellutils	(version 1.8)
 * install printf from gnu shellutils		    "    " 

 * replace ultrix syslog with a decent syslogd

 Several implementations exist, you can get one from

     gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/DEC/jtkohl-syslog-complete.tar.Z

 or any other 4.3BSD based syslogd of your choice. faxd will want to
 log to the 'err' and 'info' levels of the 'daemon' facility.

 The syslog distribution will contain a syslog.h, this should probably
 be installed like this ( or else you have to make other
 arrangements to include the new syslog.h ):

	mv /usr/include/syslog.h /usr/include/syslog.h.old
	cp syslog.h /usr/include/sys
	ln -s sys/syslog.h /usr/include



Compiling flexfax
-----------------
With the proper tools in place there should be no problems building
everything

 * edit 'configure' in the toplevel directory to use bash instead of sh

   also, depending on where you have gnu make you may need to alter
   the way PATH is built (near the top of configure). Make sure you're not
   using the standard /bin/make.

 * go on with the standard proceedure for making flexfax, i.e.

      ./configure
      make
      make install

During make there is one possible problem with include files, I'm not
sure whether this is local to my particular installation; If you get
an error like

 /usr/local/lib/g++-include/sys/fcntl.h:9:
		sys/fcntl.h: No such file or directory

edit /usr/local/g++-include/sys/fcntl.h to 

	include_next <fcntl.h>
instead of
	include_next <sys/fcntl.h>

Bugs
----

 * Hardware flowcontrol doesn't work at this time. Folks with ultrix
   source code tells me this is implicit in enabling modem control,
   i.e. clearing clocal. If I do this I can't get faxd to communicate
   with the modem at all.
   This is a known problem on sun, hopefully it can be fixed for ultrix.
