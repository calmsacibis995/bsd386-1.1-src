This is a table template to show you how to create a basic table.
If you need to specify a column width in the same field as a point
size change the two key-letters must be seperated by a space.
In this template the number of columns and the width is provided as a sample 
only, not as an example of style.  However, the fonts, point sizes, bars,
spacing between elements, and the table title are an example of style.

Tbl commands are documented in "Tbl--A Program to Format Tables" 
by M.E. Lesk in the DWB manual.

Let me know if you have any questions.
