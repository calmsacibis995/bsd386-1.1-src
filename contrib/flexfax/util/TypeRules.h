/*
 * A type rule database is an ASCII file that contains
 * type deduction and conversion rules.  The format is
 * as follows:
 *
 * FlexFAX file type rules.
 *
 * This file contains the file typing rules used by the sendfax
 * program to deduce how input files should be prepared for fax
 * transmission.  The format of this file is based on the System
 * V /etc/magic file used by the file(1) program.  The code that
 * reads this file was written entirely based on the comments that
 * exist at the top of the magic file and describe how it works.
 * The use of magic-style rules is intended to make it easier for
 * users to reuse rules already designed for use with file(1).
 *
 * The fields on each line are:
 *
 * offset: a byte offset in the file at which data should be extracted
 *	  and compared to a matching string or value.  If this value
 *	  begins with '>', then an additional rule is used and scanning
 *	  continues to the next type rule line that does not begin with
 *	  a '>'.
 * datatype: the type of data value to extract the specified offset in the
 *	  for comparison purposes.  This can be byte, short, long, or
 *	  string (a not necessarily null-terminated string of bytes).
 *	  A byte is 8 bits, short 16 bits, and long 32 bits.
 * match:  the value and operation to use in matching; the value used is
 *	  based on the datatype field.  This value may be "x" to mean
 *	  "match anything".  The operation is "=" if nothing is specified;
 *	  otherwise it can be one of ">", "<", "<=", ">=", "!=", "&"
 *	  (for checking if a set of bits is on), "^" (for xor-ing and
 *	  comparing to zero), and "!" (for checking if a set of bits is off).
 * result: one of "PS", "TIFF, or "error" (case insensitive).  The first
 *	  two results specifiy whether the rule generates a PostScript
 *	  file or a bilevel TIFF image.  The "error" result indicates a
 *	  file is unsuitable for transmission and if supplied as an
 *	  argument to sendfax, the command should be aborted.
 * rule:  a string passed to the shell to convert the input file
 *	  to the result format (suitable for sending as facsimile).
 *	  The rule string is a printf-like string that should use the
 *	  following "%" escapes:
 *		%i	input file name
 *		%o	output file name
 *		%r	output horizontal resolution in pixels/mm
 *		%R	output horizontal resolution in pixels/inch
 *		%v	output vertical resolution in lines/mm
 *		%V	output vertical resolution in lines/inch
 *		%f	data format, 1 for 1-d encoding or 2 for 2-d encoding
 *		%w	page width in mm
 *		%W	page width in pixels
 *		%l	page length in mm
 *		%L	page length in inches
 *		%s	page size by name
 *		%<x>	the <x> character (e.g. ``%%'' results in ``%''
