# FlexFAX file type rules.
#
# This file contains the file typing rules used by the sendfax
# program to deduce how input files should be prepared for fax
# transmission.  The format of this file is based on the System V
# /etc/magic file used by the file(1) program.  The code that
# reads this file was written entirely based on the comments that
# exist at the top of the magic file and describe how it works.
# The use of magic-style rules is intended to make it easier for
# users to reuse rules already designed for use with file(1).
#
# Each entry defines a type rule.  Entries normally are terminated
# by the end of a line, thought they can be continued across lines
# with a ``\'' (when this is done leading white space is converted
# to a single space).  ``#'' is a comment character; when it appears
# on a line, everything to the right is ignored.
#
# The fields in each entry are:
#
# offset: a byte offset in the file at which data should be extracted
#	  and compared to a matching string or value.  If this value
#	  begins with '>', then an additional rule is used and scanning
#	  continues to the next type rule line that does not begin with
#	  a '>'.
# datatype: the type of data value to extract the specified offset in the
#	  for comparison purposes.  This can be byte, short, long, or
#	  string (a not necessarily null-terminated string of bytes).
#	  A byte is 8 bits, short 16 bits, and long 32 bits.
# match:  the value and operation to use in matching; the value used is
#	  based on the datatype field.  This value may be "x" to mean
#	  "match anything".  The operation is "=" if nothing is specified;
#	  otherwise it can be one of ">", "<", "<=", ">=", "!=", "&"
#	  (for and-ing and comparing to zero), "^" (for xor-ing and
#	  comparing to zero), and "!" (for taking one's complement and
#	  comparing to zero).
# result: one of "PS", "TIFF, or "error" (case insensitive).  The first
#	  two results specifiy whether the rule generates a PostScript
#	  file or a bilevel TIFF image.  The "error" result indicates a
#	  file is unsuitable for transmission and if supplied as an
#	  argument to sendfax, the command should be aborted.
# rule:	  a string passed to the shell to convert the input file
#	  to the result format (suitable for sending as facsimile).
#	  The rule string is a printf-like string that should use the
#	  following "%" escapes:
#		%i	input file name
#		%o	output file name
#		%r	output horizontal resolution in pixels/mm
#		%R	output horizontal resolution in pixels/inch
#		%v	output vertical resolution in lines/mm
#		%V	output vertical resolution in lines/inch
#		%f	data format, 1 for 1-d encoding or 2 for 2-d encoding
#		%w	page width in mm
#		%W	page width in pixels
#		%l	page length in mm
#		%L	page length in inches
#		%s	page size by name
#		%F	the pathname of the fax library (e.g./usr/local/lib/fax)
#		%<x>	the <x> character (e.g. ``%%'' results in ``%''
#
# These are the "null rules"--i.e. for matching formats handled
# directly by the server.
