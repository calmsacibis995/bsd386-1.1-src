	* Version 3.65.2.

Fri May 14 16:40:09 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* vpath.c (construct_vpath_list): In removal loop for DIRPATH==0,
	set LASTPATH to PATH, not NEXT.

	* dir.c (read_dirstream): Break out of loop after incrementing
	DS->buckets such that it reaches DIRFILE_BUCKETS; avoid trying to
	dereference DS->contents->files[DIRFILE_BUCKETS].

	* read.c (read_makefile): Clear no_targets after reading a
	targetful rule line.

	* main.c (main): If print_version_flag is set, exit after printing
	the version.
	(switches): Change --version docstring to say it exits.

	* make.h [butterfly]: #undef POSIX.

Wed May 12 15:20:21 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.65.1.

	* arscan.c (ar_scan) [! AIAMAG]: Don't declare LONG_NAME.
	[AIAMAG]: Pass TRUNCATE flag arg to (*FUNCTION), always zero.

	* function.c (handle_function): Use fatal instead of
	makefile_fatal when reading_filename is nil.

	* configure.in: Add AC_GETGROUPS_T.
	* job.c (search_path): Use GETGROUPS_T in place of gid_t.

Sun May  9 15:41:25 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.65.

Fri May  7 18:34:56 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	(fatal_error_signal): Set it.
	* job.c (reap_children): Avoid nonreentrant operations if that is set.
	* make.h: Declare handling_fatal_signal.

	* expand.c (reference_variable): New function, snippet of code
	broken out of simple-reference case of variable_expand.
	(variable_expand): Use it for simple refs.
	(variable_expand): When checking for a computed variable name,
	notice a colon that comes before the final CLOSEPAREN.  Expand
	only up to the colon, and then replace the pending text with a
	copy containing the expanded name and fall through to subst ref
	handling.
	(variable_expand): Don't bother expanding the name if a colon
	appears before the first $.
	(expand_argument): Use alloca instead of savestring.
	(variable_expand): For subst ref, expand both sides of = before
	passing to [pat]subst_expand.  Use find_percent instead of lindex
	to check the lhs for a %.

Wed May  5 14:45:52 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.64.2.

Mon May  3 17:00:32 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* arscan.c (ar_name_equal) [AIAMAG]: Abort if TRUNCATED is nonzero.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Pass extra arg of 1 to parse_file_seq,
	not to multi_glob.

Thu Apr 29 19:47:33 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.64.1.

	* arscan.c (ar_scan): New local flag var LONG_NAME.  Set it when
	we read the member name in any of the fashions that allow it to be
	arbitrarily long.  Pass its negation to FUNCTION.
	(describe_member): Take TRUNCATED from ar_scan and print it.
	(ar_name_equal): Take new arg TRUNCATED; if nonzero, compare only
	the first sizeof (struct ar_hdr.ar_name) chars.
	(ar_member_pos): Take TRUNCATED from ar_scan, pass to ar_name_equal.
	* ar.c (ar_member_date_1): Likewise.

Wed Apr 28 21:18:22 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (reap_children): Before calling start_job_command to start
	the next command line, reset C->remote by calling start_remote_job_p.

Mon Apr 26 15:56:15 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* arscan.c (ar_scan): New local var NAMEMAP.
	In loop, rename NAME to NAMEBUF; new var NAME is a pointer; new
	flag IS_NAMEMAP.  When extracting the member name, always put a
	null at its end first.  If the name is "//" or "/ARFILENAMES", set
	IS_NAMEMAP.  If we have already read in NAMEMAP, and NAME looks
	like " /N", get full name from NAMEMAP+N.
	Else if NAME looks like "#1/N", read N chars from the
	elt data to be the full name.  At end of loop, if IS_NAMEMAP, read
	the elt's data into alloca'd NAMEMAP.
	(ar_name_equal): #if 0 truncating code.

	* make.h: Don't declare vfork at all.  It returns int anyway,
	unless <unistd.h> declared it; and we conflicted with some systems.

	* main.c (define_makeflags): If FLAGSTRING[1] is '-', define
	MAKEFLAGS to all of FLAGSTRING, not &FLAGSTRING[1].  Don't want to
	define it to something like "-no-print-directory".
	Use %g format instead of %f for floating-valued things.

Thu Apr 22 18:40:58 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* GNUmakefile (Makefile.in): Use a substitution ref on nolib-deps
	to change remote-%.dep to remote-stub.dep.

Wed Apr 21 15:17:54 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.64.

Fri Apr 16 14:22:22 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile (install): Remove - prefix from chgrp+chmod.

	* Version 3.63.8.

Thu Apr 15 18:24:07 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* acconfig.h: New file; contains "#undef SCCS_GET" for autoheader.
	* configure.in: If /usr/sccs/get exists, define SCCS_GET to that,
	else to "get".
	* default.c (default_variables): Set GET to macro SCCS_GET.

	* read.c (parse_file_seq): Take extra arg STRIP; strip `./' only
	if nonzero.  I hope this is the last time this argument is added
	or removed.
	(read_makefile): Pass it 1 when parsing include file names.
	Pass it 1 when parsing target file names.
	Pass it 1 when parsing static pattern target pattern names.
	* rule.c (install_pattern_rule): Pass it 1 when parsing rule deps.
	* default.c (set_default_suffixes): Pass it 1 when parsing
	default_suffixes.
	* function.c (string_glob): Pass it 0 here.

Wed Apr 14 11:32:05 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* misc.c (log_access): New function.
	({init,user,make,child}_access): Call it.
	(child_access): Abort if !access_inited.

	* main.c (switches: --no-print-directory): Use 1 instead of -1 for
	single-letter option.
	(init_switches, decode_switches, define_makeflags): An option with
	no single-letter version is no longer indicated by a value of -1;
	instead a value that is !isalnum.
	(init_switches): Don't put such switches into the string, only
	into the long_option table.

	* make.h [!NSIG] [!_NSIG]: #define NSIG 32.

	* job.c [HAVE_WAITPID]: Remove #undef HAVE_UNION_WAIT.  AIX's
	bsdcc defined WIF* to use union wait.

	* main.c (struct command_switch): Change member `c' to type int.
	(switches): Make const.
	(decode_switches): Use `const struct command_switch *'.
	(define_makeflags): Likewise.

	* default.c (default_suffix_rules): Add `-o $@' to makeinfo rules.

Mon Apr 12 12:30:04 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.7.

	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_HEADERS): Check for string.h and memory.h.
	Removed AC_MEMORY_H.
	* make.h [USG, NeXT]: Don't test these.
	[HAVE_STRING_H]: Test this to include string.h and define ANSI_STRING.
	[HAVE_MEMORY_H]: Test this instead of NEED_MEMORY_H.
	[! ANSI_STRING]: Put decls of bcopy et al here.
	[sparc]: Don't test this for alloca.h; HAVE_ALLOCA_H is sufficient.
	[HAVE_SIGSETMASK]: Test this rather than USG.
	[__GNU_LIBRARY__ || POSIX]: Don't #include <unistd.h> again.
	* main.c (main): Handle SIGCHLD if defined, and SIGCLD if defined.
	It doesn't hurt to do both if they are both defined, and testing
	USG is useless.
	* dir.c: Rationalize directory header conditionals.
	* arscan.c [HAVE_FCNTL_H]: Test this rather than USG || POSIX.

	* default.c (default_suffixes): Add `.txinfo'.
	(default_suffix_rules): Add `.txinfo.info' and `.txinfo.dvi' rules.

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Replace RECURSIVE flag
	with enum FLAVOR, which can be simple, recursive, or append.
	Recognize += as append flavor.  Set new variable VALUE in a switch
	on FLAVOR.  For append flavor, prepend the variable's old value.
	If the variable was previously defined recursive, set FLAVOR to
	recursive; if it was defined simple, expand the new value before
	appending it to the old value.  Pass RECURSIVE flag to
	define_variable iff FLAVOR == recursive.

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Use alloca and bcopy for
	NAME, instead of savestring.  Might as well use stack storage
	since we free it immediately anyway.

Thu Apr  8 18:04:43 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (start_waiting_jobs): Move decl of JOB outside of loop.

	* main.c (define_makeflags): Rename `struct flag' member `switch'
	to `cs', which is not a reserved word.

Wed Apr  7 15:30:51 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (new_job): Call start_waiting_jobs first thing.
	(start_waiting_job): Changed return type from void to int.
	Return 0 when putting the child on the waiting_jobs chain.
	(start_waiting_jobs): Don't check load and job_slots here.
	Always take a job off the chain and call start_waiting_job on it;
	give up and return when start_waiting_job returns zero.

	* main.c (define_makeflags: struct flag): Change member `char c' to
	`struct command_switch *switch'.
	(ADD_FLAG): Set that to CS instead of CS->c.
	If CS->c is -1, increment FLAGSLEN for the long name.
	When writing out FLAGS, handle FLAGS->switch->c == -1 and write
	the long name instead.

	* compatMakefile (stamp-config): New target of old config.h rule.
	Touch stamp-config after running config.status.
	(config.h): Just depend on stamp-config, and have empty commands.

Mon Apr  5 20:14:02 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c [HAVE_WAITPID]: #undef HAVE_UNION_WAIT.

	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Check for psignal.

Fri Apr  2 17:15:46 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (long_option_aliases): Remove "new"; it is already an
	unambiguous prefix of "new-file".

Sun Mar 28 16:57:17 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.6.

Wed Mar 24 14:26:19 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* vpath.c (selective_vpath_search): When adding the
	name-within-directory at the end of NAME, and we don't add a
	slash, don't copy FILENAME in one char too far into NAME.

	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Find default_shell's
	length with strlen, not numerology.

Wed Mar 17 20:02:27 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (define_makeflags): Add the elts of a string option in
	reverse order, so they come out right when reversed again.

Fri Mar 12 15:38:45 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile (make.info): Use `-o make.info'.

Thu Mar 11 14:13:00 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile (REMOTE): Set to @REMOTE@; change comments to
	reflect new use.
	(objs): Replace remote.o with remote-$(REMOTE).o.
	(srcs): Replace remote.c with remote-$(REMOTE).c.
	(remote.o): Rule removed.

	* configure.in (REMOTE): Subst this in Makefile et al; default "stub".
	Use AC_WITH to grok --with-customs arg to set REMOTE=cstms.
	* GNUmakefile (build.sh.in): Filter out remote-% from objs list.
	* build.template (REMOTE): New var; set to @REMOTE@.
	(objs): Add remote-${REMOTE}.o.

Wed Mar 10 15:12:24 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.5.

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Fix "dependent"->"dependency" in
	"Rejecting impossible" -d msg.

	* file.c (file_hash_enter): New local vars {OLD,NEW}BUCKET.  Store
	mod'd values there; never mod {OLD,NEW}HASH.

Mon Mar  8 13:32:48 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c [eta10]: Include <fcntl.h> instead of <sys/file.h>.

	* compatMakefile (VPATH): Set this to @srcdir@.
	(srcdir): Set this to $(VPATH).

	* main.c (main): New local var DIRECTORY_BEFORE_CHDIR.  Save in it
	a copy of CURRENT_DIRECTORY after the first getcwd.  Use it
	instead of CURRENT_DIRECTORY when chdir'ing back before re-execing.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Pass missing SEARCH arg to f_mtime.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Remove extraneous arg to parse_file_seq.

Mon Feb 22 14:19:38 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile ($(infodir)/$(instname).info): Use , instead of /
	as the sed delimiter char.

Sun Feb 21 14:11:04 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.4.

	* rule.h (struct rule): Removed `subdir' member.
	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): No need to clear it.
	(count_implicit_rule_limits): Set the `changed' flag in each dep
	that refers to a nonexistent directory.  No longer set rule-global
	`subdir' flag with that information.
	(print_rule_data_base): Don't record info on `subdir' flags.

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Check the DEP->changed flag rather
	than the (now gone) RULE->subdir flag.  Also test CHECK_LASTSLASH;
	if it is set, the file might exist even though the DEP->changed
	flag is set.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits): Pass "", not ".", as file
	name arg to dir_file_exists_p to check for existence of directory.

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Inside dep-finding loop, set
	CHECK_LASTSLASH from the value recorded in CHECKED_LASTSLASH[I],
	rather than computing it anew.

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): Must alloca space for PERCENT
	and copy it, to avoid leaving the trailing `)' in the value.

	* misc.c (remove_comments): Fixed backslash-checking loop
	condition to allow it to look at the first char on the line.
	P2 >= LINE, not P2 > LINE.

	* compatMakefile ($(bindir)/$(instname)): Before moving $@.new to
	$@, rm $@.old and mv $@ to $@.old.

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Take new args FILENAME and
	LINENO.  Fatal if the variable name is empty.
	* read.c (read_makefile): Change callers.
	* main.c (main): Likewise.

	* compatMakefile (group): Define to @KMEM_GROUP@, autoconf magic
	that configure will replace with the group owning /dev/kmem.

Mon Feb  8 14:26:43 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* vpath.c (vpath_search): Take second arg MTIME_PTR, pass thru to
	selective_vpath_search.
	(selective_vpath_search): Take second arg MTIME_PTR.
	If the dir cache thinks a file exists, stat it to make sure, and
	put the modtime in *MTIME_PTR.
	* remake.c (library_search): Take second arg MTIME_PTR.
	When we find a match, record its mtime there.
	Pass MTIME_PTR through to vpath_search to do same.
	(f_mtime): Pass &MTIME as new 2nd arg to {vpath,library}_search;
	store it in FILE->last_mtime if set nonzero.
	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Pass nil 2nd arg to vpath_search.

	* compatMakefile (remote.o): Prepend `$(srcdir)/' to `remote-*.c',
	so globbing looks somewhere it will find things.

	* compatMakefile ($(infodir)/$(instname).info): Install `make.info*'
	not `$(srcdir)/make.info*'; no need to use basename.

Fri Feb  5 12:52:43 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.3.

	* compatMakefile (install): Add missing ;\s.

	Make -, @, and + prefixes on a pre-expanded command line affect
	all lines in the expansion, not just the first.
	* commands.h (struct commands): Replace `lines_recurse' member
	with `lines_flags'.
	(COMMANDS_{RECURSE,SILENT,NOERROR}): New macros, bits to set in
	that flag byte.
	* commands.c (chop_commands): Set `lines_flags' instead of
	`lines_recurse'.  Record not only + but also @ and - prefixes.
	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Check the COMMANDS_RECURSE bit
	in FILE->cmds->lines_flags, rather than FILE->cmds->lines_recurse.
	* job.c (start_job_command): Replaced RECURSIVE and NOPRINT local
	var with FLAGS; initialize it to the appropriate `lines_flags' byte.
	Set CHILD->noerror if the COMMANDS_NOERROR bit is set in FLAGS.
	Set the COMMANDS_SILENT bit in FLAGS for a @ prefix.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Set G->file to its prev after
	checking for G being finished, since that check needs to examine
	G->file.

	* configure.in (union wait check) [HAVE_WAITPID]: Try using
	waitpid with a `union wait' STATUS arg.  If waitpid and union wait
	don't work together, we should not use union wait.

	* Version 3.63.2.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): When G->file->updated, move
	G->file to its prev.  We aren't finished until G->file is nil.

Thu Feb  4 12:53:04 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (starting_directory): New global variable.
	(main): Set it to cwd after doing -Cs.
	(log_working_directory): Use it, rather than computing each time.
	* make.h: Declare it.

	* compatMakefile (SHELL): Define to /bin/sh for losing Unix makes.

	* main.c (decode_env_switches): Allocate (1 + LEN + 1) words for
	ARGV, rather than LEN words plus one byte.

Wed Feb  3 18:13:52 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile ($(bindir)/$(instname)): Put - before
	install_setgid command line, so its failure won't be an error.
	(infodir): New variable.
	(install): Depend on $(infodir)/$(instname).info.
	($(infodir)/$(instname).info): New target.

	* read.c (read_makefile): If FILENAMES is nil when we see a line
	starting with a tab, don't treat it as a command.  Just fall
	through, rather than giving an error.

	* read.c (read_makefile): If the NO_TARGETS flag is set when we see a
	command line, don't clear it before continuing.  We want
	subsequent command lines to be ignored as well.

	* job.c (new_job): Before expanding each command line, collapse
	backslash-newline combinations that are inside var or fn references.

Mon Feb  1 16:00:13 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile (exec_prefix): Default to $(prefix), not /usr/local.

	* compatMakefile (make.info): Pass -I$(srcdir) to makeinfo.

	* job.c [POSIX] (unblock_sigs): Made global.
	[!POSIX] (unblock_sigs): Move defns to job.h.
	* job.h [POSIX] (unblock_sigs): Declare.

Sun Jan 31 19:11:05 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* read.c (read_makefile): In vpath parsing, after finding the
	pattern token, take entire rest of line as the search path, not
	just the next token.

	* compatMakefile (remote.o): Depend on remote-*.c.

Thu Jan 28 16:40:29 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): Don't define any F or D versions.
	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Define them here as
	recursively-expanded variables that use the dir and notdir funcs.

	* variable.c (target_environment): In v_default case, don't export
	o_default or o_automatic variables.

	* configure.in (union wait check): Remove ` and ' inside C code;
	they confuse the shell script.

Mon Jan 25 13:10:42 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.1.

	* vpath.c (construct_vpath_list): When skipping further processing
	of an elt that is ".", don't also skip the code that pushes P past
	the next separator.

	* compatMakefile (distclean): Don't remove make-*.

	* configure.in (HAVE_UNION_WAIT): Try to use WEXITSTATUS if it's
	defined.  If one cannot use WEXITSTATUS with a `union wait'
	argument, we don't want to believe the system has `union wait' at all.

	* remake.c (update_file): Do nothing to print "up to date" msgs.
	(update_goal_chain): Do it here instead.
	Use the `changed' flag of each goal's `struct dep' to keep track
	of whether files_remade (now commands_started) changed around a
	call to update_file for that goal.
	When a goal is finished, and its file's update_status is zero (i.e.,
	success or nothing done), test the `changed' flag and give an "up
	to date" msg iff it is clear.
	* make.h (files_remade): Renamed to commands_started.
	* remake.c: Changed defn.
	(update_goal_chain): Changed uses.
	* job.c (start_job_command): Increment commands_started here.
	(reap_children): Not here.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Don't do anything with files'
	`prev' members.  update_file now completely handles this.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Don't expand recursive
	variables if they came from the environment.

	* main.c (define_makeflags): For flags with omitted optional args,
	store {"", 0} with ADD_FLAG.  When constructing FLAGSTRING, a flag
	so stored cannot have more flags appended to the same word.

Fri Jan 22 14:46:16 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* variable.c (print_variable_set): In vars/bucket calculation,
	don't spuriously multiply by 100.

	* Version 3.63.

	* job.c [!HAVE_UNION_WAIT] (WTERMSIG, WCOREDUMP, WEXITSTATUS):
	Don't define if already defined.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't keep track of the command_state before
	calling update_file_1.  Remove local variable COMMANDS_FINISHED,
	and don't test it to decide to print the "is up to date" msg.
	Testing for files_remade having changed should always be sufficient.
	The old method lost when we are called in the goal chain run on a
	makefile, because the makefile's command_state is already
	`cs_finished' from the makefile chain run.

	* misc.c [HAVE_SETRE[GU]ID]: Test these to decl setre[gu]id.

	* configure.in: Rewrote wait checking.
	Use AC_HAVE_HEADERS to check for <sys/wait.h>.
	Use AC_HAVE_FUNCS to check for waitpid and wait3.
	Use a compile check to test just for `union wait'.
	* job.c: Rewrote conditionals accordingly.
	[HAVE_WAITPID]: Test this only to define WAIT_NOHANG.
	[HAVE_WAIT3]: Likewise.
	[HAVE_UNION_WAIT]: Test this to define WAIT_T and W*.

	* configure.in: Set CFLAGS and LDFLAGS before all checks.

	This happened when multiple SIGCHLDs before reap_children was called.

	* job.c (reap_children): If ERR is set, so we don't call start_job
	on the child being reaped, instead set its command_state to
	cs_finished.
	(reap_children, child_handler, new_job): I added several
	debugging printf's while fixing this.  I left them in if (debug_flag) 
	because they may be useful for debugging this stuff again.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't ignore lines containing only
	comments if they start with a tab.  Such lines should be passed to
	the shell for it to decide about the comments.

	* read.c (conditional_line): Don't evaluate an if* when we're
	already ignoring.  Instead, just push a new level, with a value of

	* main.c (main): Call install_default_implicit_rules after reading
	makefiles, not before.

	WAIT_NOHANG in terms of waitpid.
	[!_POSIX_SOURCE && (HAVE_SYS_WAIT || !USG)]: Don't #include <signal.h>
	(make.h does).
	Define macro WAIT_NOHANG in terms of wait3.
	(child_handler): #ifdef on WAIT_NOHANG, not HAVE_SYS_WAIT || !USG.
	Use WAIT_NOHANG macro instead of wait3.

	* file.h (struct file.command_state): Remove unused elt.

Wed Dec 26 18:10:26 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at albert.ai.mit.edu)

	directory doesn't exist (but a rule might make it).

	* make.h [__GNUC__]: Don't #define alloca if already #define'd.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Don't look at the target constructed for
	the empty rule when making the null-suffix rule.  Construct it over
	again, since the former may have been freed already.

	* make.h [__GNU_LIBRARY__]: Include <unistd.h> to get random fn decls.

	ANSI <string.h> and names for str/mem functions.
	Use <stdlib.h> to declare misc fns rather than explicit decls.
	[_POSIX_SOURCE]: Don't declare kill (<signal.h> will).
	Include <sys/types.h> before <signal.h> because some braindead
	nonconformant 1003.1 implementation needs it.
	* misc.c: Don't declare malloc, realloc.  Do it in make.h.
	* arscan.c, glob.c: Use sequence for string fns from make.h verbatim.
	* make.h (S_ISDIR, S_ISREG): Declare if necessary.
	* commands.c (delete_child_targets), job.c (search_path), read.c

Tue Nov 28 16:00:04 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* arscan.c (ar_name_equal) [APOLLO]: Don't do `.o' hacking.  On Apollos

	so I'm told).

Thu Nov 23 17:33:11 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at albert.ai.mit.edu)

	* load.c [hp300 && BSD] (LDAV_CVT): Define for this system.

	(command_switches: -k, -S): Use above for default value.
	(define_makeflags): Only write flag/flag_off switches if they are on,

	* main.c (struct command_switch): New member `no_makefile'.

	(main): Call define_makeflags with MAKEFILE==1 before remaking
	makefiles, and again with MAKEFILE==0 before remaking goals.

Tue Oct  2 17:16:45 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.58.12.

Mon Oct  1 15:43:23 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* arscan.c [HPUX]: Use PORTAR==1 format.

Sat Sep 29 16:38:05 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	CMDS->lines_recurse.

	* Version 3.58.11.

	* job.c (start_job): Don't always increment CHILD->command_line!  Only
	do it when CHILD->command_ptr has run out!  (Dumb bug.  Sigh.)

Thu Sep 20 02:18:51 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* GNUmakefile [ARCH]: Give explicit rule for remote.{c,dep} to use
	variable `REMOTE' for more flags.

	* commands.h (struct commands): New member `ncommand_lines', the number
	of elts in `command_lines' et al.

	* job.h (struct child): New member `command_lines' to hold
	variable-expanded command lines.
	* job.c (new_job): Store expanded command lines in `command_lines'
	member of new child.  Don't clobber FILE->cmds.
	(start_job): Use CHILD->command_lines in place of
	CHILD->file->cmds->command_lines.

	* variable.h, variable.c, job.c, expand.c: Undo yesterday's change,
	which is no longer necessary since we have cleverly avoided the issue.

	* job.c (start_job): Don't variable-expand each command line.

	containing `struct variable' pointers.
	(variables_expanding): New variable, the chain of variables currently
	being expanded.
	(recursively_expand): Don't test and set `expanding' member.
	Instead, run through the `variables_expanding' chain looking for a link

	describing V, before recursive expansion, and pop it off afterward.
	* job.c (child_handler): Save `variables_expanding' and clear it before
	calling start_job, and restore it afterward.  This avoids major lossage
	when the SIGCHLD comes in the middle of variable expansion.

Mon Sep 17 14:46:26 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c, commands.c: Don't define sigmask.
	* make.h: Put it here instead.

	* variable.c (target_environment): If `.NOEXPORT' was specified as a
	target, only export command-line and environment variables, and
	file-origin variables that were in the original environment.

Thu Sep 13 14:10:02 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* load.c [UMAX]: Move #include <sys/sysdefs.h> to [not UMAX_43].

	so we don't write off the end of allocated space.

	* arscan.c (ar_name_equal): Fixed to work when MEM is AR_NAMELEN-1 but
	NAME is not the same length.

Sat Aug 25 16:17:14 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech)

	* job.c (construct_command_argv_internal): Use a static char array for

	to exec_command.
	(start_job): Don't pass FILE arg to child_execute_job.
	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Ditto.
	* main.c (main): Don't pass path and shell to exec_command.

Fri Aug 17 23:17:27 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech)

	* job.c (construct_command_argv_internal): New fn broken out of
	construct_command_argv.  Takes strings SHELL and IFS instead of doing
	variable expansion for them.  Recurse to make an argv for SHELL,
	passing SHELL==0.  When SHELL==0, don't recurse for shell argv; make a
	simple one using /bin/sh.
	(construct_command_argv): Do the variable expansions and call above.

Thu Aug 16 19:03:14 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech)

	* Version 3.58.8.

	* main.c (decode_switches): For positive_int and floating cases, move
	SW past the arg (and don't set it to ""), so another switch can follow.

Fri Aug  3 00:43:15 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* job.c (child_execute_job): Use unblock_signals instead of
	push_signals_blocked_p (0).

	fatal_error_signal.

	to {push,pop}_signals_blocked_p.
	* job.c (child_handler): Call {block,unblock}_signals instead of just
	{block,unblock}_remote_children.  We need to block the fatal signals.

Thu Aug  2 22:41:06 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* main.c, function.c: Fixed typos in comments.

	* job.c (construct_command_argv): Always use
	allocated_variable_expand_for_file instead of variable_expand_for_file
	because we might be called from inside a variable expansion (for the
	`shell' function).

	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Free the arglist's storage
	correctly.  construct_command_argv only allocates ARGV and ARGV[0].

	* job.c (children_blocked_p_idx): Renamed to children_blocked_p_depth.
	(push_children_blocked_p, pop_children_blocked_p): Use ..._depth
	instead of ..._idx, and do it right!

Wed Jul 11 15:35:43 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.h (SIGNAL): New macro to replace `signal' calls.  Does arg and
	ret value casts to (void *) #ifdef __STDC__ to avoid conflicts btwn
	ANSI and BSD `signal' and handler types.
	* main.c (main), job.c (child_handler): Use it.

Fri Jul  6 00:00:38 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* ar.c (ar_member_date, ar_touch): Pass 2nd arg to f_mtime.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Search the include path for MAKEFILES
	variable makefiles (TYPE == 1), like it says in the manual.

	references into the archive and member names.
	(ar_member_date, ar_touch): Use it.
	* make.h: Declare it.

	* remake.c (f_mtime): After doing rename_file, do check_renamed instead
	of assuming rename_file will always set FILE->renamed (which it won't).

	* vpath.c (selective_vpath_search): Only accept prospective files that
	don't actually exist yet are mentioned in a makefile if the file we are
	searching for isn't a target.

	file_mtime.
	(check_dep): Ditto after update_file.

	* file.c (rename_file): Prettied up long message for merging cmds.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Get each dep file's modtime, and allow for
	it being renamed, before checking for a circular dep, since a renaming
	may have introduced one.

Tue Jul  3 18:15:01 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* ar.c (ar_touch): Don't free ARNAME since enter_file holds onto the
	storage.

Mon Jul  2 14:10:16 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): No longer take NAME arg.  Instead take
	ARCHIVE flag.  If ARCHIVE is nonzero, FILE->name is of the form
	"LIB(MEMBER)"; rule for "(MEMBER)" is searched for, and LASTSLASH is
	set to nil.  Since NAME was only non-nil when it was the archive member
	name passed by try_implicit_rule, this change easily allows turning off
	LASTSLASH checking for archive members without excessive kludgery.
	(try_implicit_rule): Pass ARCHIVE flag instead of file name.

	* Version 3.58.5.

	* commands./c (set_file_variables): Don't kill last char of $(^D) elts.

Sat Jun 30 00:53:38 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

Wed Jun 27 14:38:49 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* main.c (main): Put a newline on the debugging message when deciding
	not to remake a makefile to avoid a possible loop.
	Only decide not to remake makefiles that have commands (as well as
	being targets and having no deps).

Fri Jun 22 12:35:37 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* default.c (default_variables): Define `LINK.s' and `LINK.S'.
	(default_suffix_rules): Define .S.o rule.

	* job.c (construct_command_argv): If we decide to go the slow route,
	free all storage for the chopped args.

	* dir.c: Copied dirent vs direct et al mess from glob.c.

	* glob.c: Replaced with updated version from djm.
	* glob.c: Check macro DIRENT instead of _POSIX_SOURCE for <dirent.h>.
	__GNU_LIBRARY__ implies DIRENT and STDC_HEADERS.

	* vpath.c (vpath_search): Don't stop the loop if a pattern matches but
	the search fails.  All matching patterns have their paths searched
	(like it says in the manual).

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Directory Search: Selective Search): Say that
	multiple `vpath' directives with the same pattern DO accumulate, not
	supersede earlier ones.

	* vpath.c (print_vpath_data_base): Increment the count of vpaths on
	each loop iteration, rather than letting it stay zero.

	* Version 3.58.3.

	* job.c (block_children, unblock_children): Made static.
	(push_children_blocked_p, pop_children_blocked_p): New functions to
	push and pop whether children are blocked or not.
	* job.h: Declare push_children_blocked_p, pop_children_blocked_p and
	not block_children, unblock_children.
	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal), job.c (wait_for_children, new_job,
	child_execute_job), main.c (main, log_working_directory): Use sequences
	of push_children_blocked_p (1) and pop_children_blocked_p () instead of
	explicitly blocking and unblocking children.
	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Don't unblock children.  The
	push-pop sequence in wait_for_children makes it unnecessary.

Tue May 29 21:30:00 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (do_define): Don't include the last newline in the definition.

	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Call construct_command_argv
	before forking and don't fork if it returns nil.  Free the argument
	list's storage before finishing.

	* job.c (start_job): Free the storage for the child's argument list
	in the parent side of the fork after the child has been spawned.

	* job.c (start_job): If construct_command_argv returns nil, go to the
	next command line.

	* job.c (construct_command_argv): Use the shell if the command contains
	an unterminated quote.

Wed May 23 19:54:10 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.58.2.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Parse "override define" correctly.

Thu May 17 15:25:58 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* arscan.c [USG]: Don't declare memcpy and memcmp.  <memory.h> should
	do this anyway (and lack of declarations is harmless).

	* remote-customs.c: Renamed to remote-cstms.c for System V.
	* remote.c [CUSTOMS]: Changed accordingly.

Sun May 13 14:38:39 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* GNUmakefile: Use same cmds for doc tar.Z as for dist tar.Z (so the
	contents go in make-N.NN).

	* Version 3.58.1.

Wed Apr 25 20:27:52 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* job.c (init_siglist): Don't do SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 if they are the
	same as SIGIO and SIGURG (true on Cray).

Tue Apr 24 20:26:41 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* arscan.c (ar_scan): Do behavior for PORTAR == 1 and USGr3 also
	#ifdef APOLLO.

Wed Apr 11 10:00:39 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* job.c (exec_command): Set the effective GID to the real GID.  Somehow
	this code got lost.

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Use the right index variable when
	seeing if we need to expand FILE->also_make.

Sun Mar  4 09:18:58 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.58.0.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Treat non-targets without commands under -t
	the same as anything else without commands.

	* default.c (default_variables: PREPROCESS.S): Removed $< from defn.

	* main.c (main): Ignore arguments that are the empty string, rather
	than feeding them to enter_file and barfing therein.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits): Redid loop control to not run
	twice on freed rules.

	* GNUmakefile: Made `.dep' files be architecture-specific too.

	* main.c (main, log_working_directory) [USG]: Block children around
	calls to `getwd' (actually `getcwd' on USG), because that function
	sometimes spawns a child running /bin/pwd on USG.

Tue Jan 30 14:02:50 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* function.c (subst_expand): Pay attention to SUFFIX_ONLY, putz.

Wed Jan 24 21:03:29 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.man: Fixed repeated word.

	* make.texinfo (Missing): Reworded a buggy sentence.

Sat Jan 20 11:52:01 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	it might not have been malloc'd.

	* job.c (construct_command_argv): Call
	allocated_variable_expand_for_file instead of variable_expand_for_file
	to expand `$(SHELL)'.

	* make.texinfo (Bugs): Change address from roland@wheaties.ai.mit.edu
	to roland@prep.ai.mit.edu.

Tue Jan 16 19:22:33 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.57.5.

Sun Jan 14 16:48:01 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* job.c (start_job): Only call wait_to_start_job for the first command
	line in each sequence.

	(check_renamed): Macro to check for a file having been renamed.
	Dereferences the renaming and sets the given variable.
	* file.c (rename_file): Completely rewritten.  Renames in place if
	possible, or moves FILE to a different hash bucket if there is no

	new name, FILE is merged into it and FILE->renamed is set to point to
	it.
	* variable.c (merge_variable_sets): New fn to merge two variable sets.
	(merge_variable_set_lists): New fn to merge two variable set lists.
	* variable.h: Declare merge_variable_set_lists.

	* remake.c (f_mtime): Take new arg SEARCH.  Only do VPATH and `-lNAME'
	searching if it is nonzero.

	`make' itself (instead of the manual) has various chapters.
	(Variables: Advanced: Substitution Refs): When pxref'ing about
	`patsubst', use node `Text Functions', not `Functions'.
	Add an xref about `patsubst' after description of $(var:a%b=c%d).
	(Functions: Syntax of Functions): Explain why mixing delimiters in
	function/var refs is unwise.  Clarify fn arg evaluation order.
	(Options): Reworded sentence about `-e'.
	(Implicit: Implicit Variables): Don't say `RM' is unused.
	Say the dflt values for the flag vars is empty unless otherwise noted,
	since some have defaults.
	(Implicit: Pattern Rules: Pattern Examples): Clarified use of $< and $@
	in first example.
	(Implicit: Last Resort): Don't say the .DEFAULT example creates files
	"silently".  It's automatic, but not silent.
	(Implicit: Search Algorithm): Fixed confusing ungrammatical sentence
	for item 5.1.
	(Archives: Archive Update): Added missing `next' pointer.
	(Archives: Archive Symbols): Note that GNU `ar' deals with this
	automatically.

	* job.c (search_path): New fn, to search for an executable file in a
	search path (broken out of exec_command).
	(exec_command): Take fourth arg, the shell program to use (if
	necessary).  Use search_path for the program, and the shell program.
	Pass args "file args ..." to shell program (with no -c), where FILE is
	the full pathname of the program (script) to be run.
	(child_execute_job): Pass shell program to exec_command.
	* main.c (main): Ditto.

	* main.c (main): Don't write a message if exec_command returns, because

	try to free it.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Took code to force remake of nonexistent
	deps out of #if 0, and changed the test to nonexistent non-intermediate

	implement the new feature that if a: b and b: c and c is newer than a,
	b need not be remade.

Sun Nov 26 16:12:41 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* compatMakefile (load.o, remote.o): Use $*.c instead of explicit file

	being updated.  (The exact opposite test was here before; why???)
	(update_file_1): Set a dep's `changed' member after updating it if it
	is phony and has commands (because they will then always be executed).

	won't be taken from an included makefile.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): #if 0 out setting MUST_MAKE if a dep
	doesn't exist.

	loses if ! FILE->is_target.

	* make.texinfo (Variables: Setting): Don't say that spaces after a

	deps from the chain.
	* main.c (main): Do it here, before calling update_goal_chain.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): When updating fails, change STATUS even
	if MAKEFILES is set.  Also stop remaking when updating fails if not

	the `dontcare' flag set.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Don't always remake if FILE has cmds but no
	deps; only if FILE is double-colon.  (I don't know why this should be
	done for double-colon targets, but that's what Unix make does.)

	* load.c [LDAV_BASED] (load_average): Write error messages if the
	various system calls fail.  Keep track of if we've failed before.
	The first time we fail, write a message saying -l won't be enforced.
	The first time we succeed after having failed, write a message saying
	-l will be enforced again.

	* remake.c [USG]: Don't #include <sys/file.h>

	* load.c [generic Unix LDAV_BASED]: #include <fcntl.h> #ifdef USG,
	else <sys/file.h> instead.

	* job.c [USG && !USGr3 && !HAVE_DUP2]: Remove redundant
	#include <errno.h> and declaration of `errno'.
	[...] (dup2): Fixed so it won't always lose.

	* default.c (default_suffix_rules: .texinfo.dvi): Copy, rather than

	* compatMakefile: Remove redundant comment.

	* load.c [generic Unix LDAV_BASED]: Include <a.out.h> instead of
	<nlist.h>, since the `struct nlist' declaration in <nlist.h> varies
	more than the one in <a.out.h>.
	(load_average): Use the `n_un.n_name' field of the `struct nlist',
	since the <a.out.h> declaration uses the union.

	* main.c (main): For the temporary files made for stdin makefiles, set
	the `intermediate' and `dontcare' flags.
	* file.c (remove_intermediates): Don't print any messages for files
	whose `dontcare' flag is set.  (The only files that will be
	intermediate and `dontcare' will be the temporary files made for stdin
	makefiles.)

	* job.h: Declare it.
	* main.c (main): Use exec_command when re-execing.

	* make.h: Declare environ.

	(install): Depend on $(mandir)/make.$(manext).
	($(mandir)/make.$(manext)): Depend on make.man and copy it to $@.

	FILE->update_status to zero before returning.

	cares.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Wildcards: Wildcard Examples): Give this node a

	members in the loop that prints the newer/older debugging messages.
	* remake.c (update_file_1): If no deps changed and FILE has no
	commands, decide it doesn't need remaking.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Print a debugging message if we take
	commands from default_file.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Directory Search: Selective Search): Removed
	note about warning for `vpath' with a constant pathname, since it isn't

	makefile, and it got updated, don't change STATUS, so we can still
	return -1 (meaning nothing was done).  This avoids an infinite loop on
	"make -n Makefile".

Sat Aug 12 23:14:24 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Treat -q the same as -n.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Fixed handling of return from
	update_file.  If -n or -q is in effect, ignore it.

	* job.c (start_job): Don't test for -t.  We should never get called in
	that case.

Fri Aug 11 04:09:14 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* function.c (expand_function): Removed unused variables.

	increment files_remade.
	(remake_file): Don't increment files_remade.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't print "up to date" messages for
	phony files.

	* job.c (child_handler): Don't set C->file->update_status to 1 if
	start_job returns nonzero under -n or -t.

	* expand.c (variable_expand): Count parens in $(foo:a=b) refs.

	* main.c: Removed old declaration of `glob_tilde' (which hasn't existed

Tue Aug  8 23:53:43 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (exec_command): Fixed to not ignore the last path component and
	to do the right thing with an empty path.

Fri Aug  4 15:58:19 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (library_file_mtime): Look for libLIB.a, not /libLIB.a.

	* remake.c (remake_file): If FILE has no commands and is a target,
	don't set its time to now.  The time gets reset by notice_finished_file
	anyway, and it isn't needed since check_dep checks for nonexistence.

	* Version 3.54.6.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't read off the end of the string after an
	`include'.

	* job.c (exec_command): New function to search the path for a file and
	execute it.
	(start_job): Use exec_command rather than execvp.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Expand `include' directive args before
	parsing them.  Allow trailing whitespace after filename.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Put makelevel + 1, rather than
	makelevel, in the `MAKELEVEL' envariable.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Don't get the new modtime of phony
	files.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Run commands instead of touching under -t if
	FILE->cmds->any_recurse is set.

	* commands.h (struct commands): Add new member `any_recurse', to be set
	nonzero if any `lines_recurse' element is nonzero.
	* commands.c (chop_commands): Set the `any_recurse' member.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Split chopping of commands into
	lines into new function chop_commands.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Directory Search: Selective Search): Fixed
	example to use correct `vpath' syntax.

	directory names.

	* job.c (wait_for_children): Changed "waiting for children" message to
	"waiting for unfinished jobs".

Thu Jul 13 18:44:49 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* variable.c (pop_variable_scope): Don't free the head of the chain of
	variables in each bucket twice.

	* GNUmakefile: Include COPYING in the doc tar file.

	* variable.c, read.c, misc.c, job.c, function.c: Replace some identical
	"for" loops with next_token or end_of_token calls.

Fri Jul  7 20:53:13 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* misc.c (collapse_line): Copy the line over in the right place.

Fri Jul  7 18:33:24 1989  Roland McGrath    (fsf at void.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c: Conditionalize inclusion of <sys/file.h> on not
	USG, since HP-UX defines a `struct file' there.

Fri Jul  7 12:11:30 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c: If WTERMSIG is defined by <sys/wait.h>, define WAIT_T as int,
	and don't define other macros; this covers HP-UX.
	If WTERMSIG is not defined, use int or union wait based on USG and
	HAVE_SYS_WAIT; this covers BSD and SysV.

	* expand.c (variable_expand): When expanding recursive variable
	references (${${a}}), use the correct delimiters in the constructed
	variable reference.

Mon Jul  3 18:29:26 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile: Clear out and redefine the .SUFFIXES list because
	silly Sun 4 make defines .cps.h.

	* compatMakefile: Fix comment about -DNO_MINUS_C_MINUS_O.

	* remake.c: Include <sys/file.h> for O_* on 4.2.

Thu Jun 29 17:14:32 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* expand.c (variable_expand): When terminating the variable expansion
	buffer, use variable_buffer_output instead of a simply zero store,
	because the buffer may need to be enlarged.

Wed Jun 28 16:53:47 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.54.

	* default.c (default_suffixes): Added `.ln'.
	(default_suffix_rules): Changed lint rules to use -C.

Thu Jun 22 20:49:35 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (start_job): Set `environ' to CHILD->environment before execing
	in the child process!

Tue Jun 20 17:23:13 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at spiff.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile: Put job.h and rule.h in `srcs'.

	* job.c (start_job): If there are no more commands, return nonzero
	under -n or -t.

Sun Jun 18 13:07:45 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* GNUmakefile (depend): Split commands into two lines so they won't be
	so long when variable-expanded.

	* compatMakefile: Documented MINUS_C_MINUS_O meaning.  The line

	* Version 3.52.

Mon Jun 12 17:45:11 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (check_dep): Drop circular dependencies instead of fataling.
	(update_file_1 already does this.)

	* default.c (default_suffix_rules): For .s -> .o, put the -o flag to
	the assembler before the source file name.

Sun Jun 11 12:00:52 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	filename, since it might not be malloc'd.  When doing an included
	makefile, free the name's storage.

	`MAKEFILES'.  Free the storage for the names of -f makefiles.
	(read_makefile): Allocate storage for the makefile name in the
	`struct file' in read_makefiles.

	* make.texinfo (Running: Instead of Execution): Document the effect of

	* make.c (main, log_working_directory, decode_switches,
	decode_env_switches, define_makeflags, die, print_version,
	print_data_base): Moved to new file main.c.

	here.  When chopping the commands up into lines, don't chop at
	backslash-newlines.
	(start_job): Collapse backslash-newlines after printing the line.

	* commands.c (start_job): Don't collapse backslash-newlines here.

	the commands up into lines.

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): Initialize the length counters for
	$^ and $? to zero!

	* commands.c (start_job): Use vfork instead of fork.  Someone else says
	the child and parent DO have separate file descriptors.

	and made global.

Sat Jun 10 00:11:25 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (library_file_mtime): Check for libNAME.a in the current
	directory before doing VPATH search.

	* variable.c (print_variable_set): Don't write "# Variables", and write
	fewer blank lines.
	(print_variable_data_base): Precede the variables with "# Variables".

	* make.c (main): Print the data base under -p after doing everything
	else, just before exitting.  This way it gets info determined in
	updating the goal targets.

	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Split into print_variable,
	which prints one variable, and print_variable_set, which prints a set.
	Replaced with a call to print_variable_set for the global set.
	(print_file_variables): New function to print a given file's local
	variables.

	* file.c (print_file_data_base): Call print_file_variables to print

	the $^ and $? variables!!!

	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Pattern Rules: Automatic): Document new D and
	F versions of $^ and $?.

	* commands.c (start_job): In the child fork, use getdtablesize and a
	loop to close all file descriptors other than 0, 1, and 2.  We need to
	do this since not only the bad stdin pipe, but also some directories,
	may be open.

	* commands.c (start_job): Use fork instead of vfork, because a vfork
	parent and child share file descriptors, and our child needs to diddle
	with stdin.

	* variable.c (initialize_file_variables): When created a new variable
	set, zero out the hash table.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Don't use variables whose names are
	not made up of alphanumerics and underscores.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set the `parent' member of each dependency
	to FILE before updating it.

	* file.h (struct file): Add `parent' member.

	allocated_variable_expand_for_file, calling variable_expand_for_file,
	and taking second arg FILE.
	(allocated_variable_expand): New function, a wrapper around
	allocated_variable_expand_for_file, passing a nil second arg.

Fri Jun  9 12:11:45 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	before calling start_job.
	(start_job): Set up CHILD->environment before running the commands if
	it is nil.

	run with the environment make was called with.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Don't check C->command_ptr before calling
	start_job since we now have to check C->file->cmds->command_lines and
	it's easier to let start_job handle all that.

	* commands.c (struct child): New member `command_line', to hold an
	index into file->cmds->command_lines.
	(execute_file_commands): Set the new child's `command_line' to 0 and
	its `commands' and `commands_ptr' to nil.
	(start_job): When CHILD->command_ptr runs out, increment
	CHILD->command_line and run the corresponding line from
	CHILD->file->cmds->command_lines.  Run it even under -t, -q, or -n if
	the CHILD->file->cmds->lines_recurse element for that line is set.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Chop CMDS up into lines, setting
	its `command_lines' and `lines_recurse' members, if it wasn't already
	chopped.

	* commands.h (struct commands): New members `command_lines' and
	`lines_recurse'.  The first is an array of chopped-up lines; the second
	is an array of flags, each nonzero if the corresponding line is
	recursive.

	* variable.c (variable_expand_for_file): If FILE is nil, just do a
	vanilla variable_expand.
	(expand_function: `shell'): Pass second arg (as nil) to
	construct_command_argv.

	* commands.c (construct_command_argv): Use variable_expand_for_file on
	`$(SHELL)' and `$(IFS)' instead of lookup_variable to check those
	variables.  This handles file-local and recursive values correctly.
	To support this, take an additional argument FILE.

	* variable.c (initialize_file_variables): New function to initialize
	FILE's variable set list from PARENT's setlist.  PARENT is the
	immediate dependent that caused FILE to be remade, or nil if FILE is a
	goal.  (When user-level per-file variables are implemented, PARENT
	should be passed as nil when defining per-file variables.)

	* variable.c (variable_expand_for_file): New function to expand a line
	using the variable set of a given file, and reporting error messages
	for the file and line number of that file's commands.

	* variable.h: Don't declare lookup_variable_for_file.

	* variable.c (lookup_variable_*): Turned back into lookup_variable.  It
	now uses current_setlist.
	(global_setlist): New static `struct variable_set_list', a setlist
	containing global_variable_set.
	(current_setlist): New static `struct variable_set_list *', a pointer
	to the current variable set list.
	(define_variable): Define in the current top-level set, not the global
	set.

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): New function to set up the automatic
	variables for a file in its own variable set.
	(execute_file_commands): Use set_file_variables.

	* variable.c (new_environ): Replaced with target_environment, taking an
	argument FILE, and returning an environment for FILE's commands.

	* variable.c, variable.h: Remove all global special variable pointers.

	* variable.c (define_variable_for_file): New function like
	define_variable, but takes additional arg FILE, and defines the
	variable in the variable set at the top of FILE's chain.
	(lookup_variable_for_file): New function like lookup_variable, but
	takes additional arg FILE, and looks the variable up in all of FILE's
	variable sets.

	* file.h (struct file): New member `variables', a `struct
	variable_set_list' containing the list of variable sets used in the
	expansion of the file's commands.

	* variable.c (variables): Replaced with static `struct variable_set'
	global_variable_set.
	(define_variable): Now define_variable_in_set, taking additional
	argument SET, the `struct variable_set' to define it in.
	(define_variable): Use define_variable_in_set with global_variable_set.
	(lookup_variable): Now lookup_variable_in_set, taking additional
	argument SET, the `struct variable_set' to look it up in.
	(lookup_variable): Use lookup_variable_in_set with global_variable_set.
	(lookup_variable_in_setlist): New function to look up a variable in a
	`struct variable_set_list' using lookup_variable_in_set.

	* variable.h (struct variable_set): New structure, containing a hash
	table and the number of hash buckets.
	(struct variable_set_list): New structure, containing a link for a
	linked-list, and a `struct variable_set'.

	* commands.c (start_job): Under -n, return what the recursive start_job
	call returns, since it might actually start a child.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Wildcards): Document ~ and ~USER expansion.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): If start_job returns
	failure, but -t is set, set FILE->update_status to success.
	(start_job): If -t is set, and the commands are not recursive, return
	failure (is is done for -q).

	* remake.c (touch_file): New function to touch FILE.
	(remake_file): Use touch_file.  When touching a file, still do
	execute_file_commands.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Don't check question_flag (-q), since we
	can't know here if the commands are recursive.

	* commands.c (start_job): Don't use the `recursive' member of
	CHILD->file->cmds.  Instead, check for leading +s and $(MAKE) or
	${MAKE} in the command line here.

	* commands.h (struct commands): Remove `recursive' member.

	* rule.c (install_default_pattern_rules): Remove use of `recursive'
	member.

	* read.c (record_files): Don't check commands from $(MAKE) and set
	their `recursive' member.

	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal): Treat SIGQUIT like SIGINT, SIGHUP,
	and SIGTERM, but don't send it to ourselves because it will cause a
	core dump.

	* variable.c (recursively_expand): New function to recursively expand
	its argument (a `struct variable'), returning the malloc'd value.
	(variable_expand): Use recursively_expand.

Sun May 28 12:49:27 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (main): Fixed buggy fix in deciding to increase space for
	command-line variable definitions.  (First it never did it, then it
	always did it; now it does it when necessary.)

	expansion in an allocated buffer, rather than the static one.

	* variable.c (define_variable, lookup_variable): Use a smarter hashing
	algorithm (the same one used for files and directories).
	(VARIABLE_BUCKETS): Increased to 523.

	* file.c (enter_file, lookup_file, rename_file): Use a smarter hashing
	algorithm, spreading the bits about somewhat.

	non-rule lines with `#'s.

	* dir.c (print_dir_data_base): Precede all lines with `#'s.

	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Changed format so that it can
	be makefile input.  Lines that are not variable definitions are
	preceded with `#'.  Nonrecursive variable definitions are made with all
	dollar signs doubled to reproduce the initial value.  Recursive
	variable definitions containing newlines are done with `define'
	directives.  Nonrecursive variable definitions containing newlines, and
	variable names containing :, =, or newlines, will come out garbled.

Wed May 24 00:20:04 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.49.

	patsubst_expand so as to avoid find_percent and thus disallow
	quoting the %s.

	* read.c (record_files): Pass new args to patsubst_expand.

	* variable.c (patsubst_expand): Take two new args: PATTERN_PERCENT
	and REPLACE_PERCENT.  Each of these, if non-nil, means that PATTERN

	PATTERN_PERCENT (or REPLACE_PERCENT) is the result.

	* make.h: Declare find_percent instead of pattern_p.

	* read.c (pattern_p): Changed to find_percent, returning a pointer
	to the %, or nil if there is none.
	(record_files): Take another arg, PATTERN_PERCENT, a pointer to the
	% in PATTERN.

	* read.c (pattern_p): Made global.
	* make.h: Declare pattern_p.

	* read.c (pattern_p): New function to search for an unquoted % in a
	string.  Backslashes quote %s and backslashes.  Quoting backslashes
	are removed from the string by compacting it into itself.  Returns
	nonzero if an unquoted % was found, zero if not.
	(record_files): Use pattern_p to check for implicit rules.
	(read_makefile): Use pattern_p to check for static pattern rules.
	Also use it to allow quoted %s in `vpath' patterns; warn about
	`vpath' patterns with no %s.

	changes to allow for strange compiler syntax.

	* rule.c (default_variables): Don't include "> $@" in
	$(PREPROCESS.S), since it's already in the .S.s rule.

	* compatMakefile (all): Don't depend on `doc'.

	* compatMakefile (clean): Don't remove make-info*.

Mon Apr 10 19:31:34 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Put rules with `subdir' flags set in
	TRYRULES, since these might be valid with VPATHs.  In the TRYRULES
	loop, don't do lookup_file or file_exists_p calls for dependencies

	* commands.c (child_handler): Free the good stdin before running the
	next command line.

	* commands.c [USG] (init_siglist): Don't case SIGEMT if it's not
	defined.  Do case SIGDANGER (for IBM RT) if it is defined.

	incrementing the count of files remade.

	* commands.c [USG] (init_siglist): If both SIGCHLD and SIGCLD are
	defined, don't put them both in the `switch'.

Fri Mar 24 15:08:46 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.44.

	* file.c (rename_file): If a `struct file' for the renamed-to name
	exists, and it is a target or has deps or commands, barf.
	If not just remove the old one for put in the new one.

	* remake.c (update_file_1, check_dep): Changed it back so that equal
	modtimes to NOT make dependencies be considered newer.  RCS checks
	out files with equal modtimes as the RCS files, so this screws it.

	* make.h, glob.c: If __GNUC__ is defined, use __builtin_alloca.

	* Makefile: Use variables `ALLOCA' and `ALLOCASRC' so systems
	without a good standard alloca can get it from the Emacs

	* make.c: Removed debugging version of getwd.

	* Version 3.42.

	* rule.c (default_variables): Set F77 to $(FC) and F77FLAGS to
	$(FFLAGS) so explicit rules expecting these (which are in System V)
	will work.  However, there is no way to make setting these affect
	the implicit rules, unless we trash FC and FFLAGS (which BSD uses).
	[USG]: Set GET to `get' rather than `/usr/sccs/get'.

Sun Mar 19 20:00:27 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* file.c (rename_file): If a file with the new name already existed,
	use the same storage space, after freeing the old file's name, deps,

	Also write an error message telling the user to report the incident;
	I don't think this should be able to happen, but I'm not sure.

	names together!  Reset HASHVAL before computing the second value.

	search paths of all VPATHs, making the `exists' members correspond
	to reality.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Call check_changed_vpaths.

	* make.h: Declare check_changed_vpaths.

	* vpath.c (struct vpath): New element `exists', an array of char

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Don't set *MAKEFILES to the name of
	the end of the read_makefiles chain, since the latter may be from an
	included makefile.  (Why did I do this before?)

	* make.c (main): Set argv[0] to "" if it was nil.  Don't put the
	command-line variable definitions into argv[0], only into the MAKE

	"Waiting for children" message, since they will die quickly.

	* Version 3.37.

	bitshifting explicitly (and incorrectly).

	* remote.c (remote_kill): New function to send a signal to a
	remote child.

	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal): If we get a SIGTERM, send one to

	* variable.c (expand_function: `shell'): Use
	`shell_function_completed'.  Block children before forking and
	unblock after `shell_function_pid' is set properly and
	`shell_functon_completed' is reset to 0.

	* commands.c (child_handler): When the child of the `shell' function
	completes, set `shell_function_completed' to 1 if it actually ran,
	or -1 if it didn't (due to fork or exec failure).

	* commands.c (block_children, unblock_children): New functions to
	block and unblock the child termination signal.
	(wait_for_children): Use block_children and unblock_children.

Wed Feb  1 18:05:07 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at pepper.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.33.

	* version.c: Removed copyright notice, since this is a one-line file.

	* commands.c (error_status): Made it return BUF, rather than running
	off the end (this apparently worked on Sun 3s for some reason).

	* ar.c, commands.c, dep.h, load.c, make.c, make.h, read.c, remake.c,
	rule.c, variable.c, Makefile: Changed copyrght notices to cover 1989.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Don't touch phony targets.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Fixed an incorrect length passed to
	savestring.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `shell'): Close the read side of the
	pipe on the parent side of the fork.

	BAD_STDIN fd if we're not using it.

	* read.c (record_files): A file beginning with a dot can be a
	default target if it also contains a slash (as in `../foo').

	* commands.c (wait_for_children): For BSD, block SIGCHLD rather than
	ignoring it to avoid a race condition when child_handler is returning.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Do blocking waits.

	of child_handler).

	doesn't clobber the first one.

	* make.texinfo: Documented default implicit rule changes.

	* rule.c: Revamped default suffix rules.  They now use Sun's style
	of using variables `COMPILE.c', `LINK.c', etc. for each suffix, and
	use `TARGET_ARCH' and `TARGET_MACH' variable where appropriate.
	Also support Modula-2 compilation (suffixes .sym, .def, and .mod).
	Ratfor Yacc support is gone, since nobody has yacc -r.
	All EFL support is gone, since nobody uses EFL.

	* ar.c, arscan.c: Don't assume `long int' and `int' are the same.

	* commands.c [USG]: Fixed wait status bit encoding.
	[USG and not USGr3] (dup2): Define this for SysVr2.

	* ar.c (ar_member_date, ar_touch): Truncate member names to 15 chars.

	* Version 3.30.

	* commands.c [SYS_WAIT]: If this is defined, use BSD <sys/wait.h>

	clears its commands.

	* rule.c (default_suffixes): Added `.sh'.
	(default_suffix_rules): Added single-suffix .sh rule, copies source

	* rule.c (default_variables), make.texinfo (Implicit Variables):
	Variable AR defaults to `ar', ARFLAGS to `rv', and RM to `rm -f'.

	* rule.c (install_default_pattern_rules): Default variables are made
	recursive.
	(default_variables): Added "CPP", defined to "$(CC) -E".
	(default_suffixes): Added `.S', before `.s'.
	(default_suffix_rules): New rule for .S to .s, runs CPP.
	All rules that use CPP now include "$(CPPFLAGS)".

	[USG] (init_siglist): New function to initialize sys_siglist.

	* make.texinfo (Variables: Reference): Documented `$(foo:PAT=SUB)'
	references.

	* variable.c (variable_expand): A reference `$(foo:PAT=SUB)' is
	equivalent to `$(patsubst PAT,SUB,$(foo))'.

	* variable.c (variable_expand): Free the storage for the expansion
	of a recursive variable when it is nod longer needed.

	* variable.c (variable_expand): When checking for `$($(foo))', use
	lindex so as not to search for the second `$' outside the parens.

	* make.c (struct stringlist, main, decode_switches): Changed `index'
	member to `idx'.

Sat Dec 24 16:02:32 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (wait_for_children [USG]): Handle SIGCLD with SIG_DFL,
	rather than SIG_IGN.  Ignoring SIGCLD reportedly makes wait return -1.

	* arscan.c [USGr3]: Define PORTAR to 1 (as with sun386).
	(ar_scan [USGr3]): Remove trailing slashes from member names.

Thu Dec 22 17:54:05 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.texinfo (Makefiles: Overriding Makefiles): New node
	documenting use of .DEFAULT to have one makefile defer unmakeable
	targets to another.

	* make.c (struct command_switch, command_switches, et al): New
	member `noarg_value', if not nil, ptr to value to use if no arg is

	can now be given w/o an arg, to mean infinite jobs.
	* commands.c: If job_slots is zero, infinite jobs.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles, read_makefile): Make makefiles precious.

	* make.c (decode_switches): For a positive_int or floating option,
	if we moved to the next argument word, but found no argument for the
	option, move back to the correct word.

	* make.c (decode_switches): If we got any unknown options, die after
	processing all arguments.

	* GNUmakefile: Moved `include depend' to the end, so the default
	goal will be set before then.

	* load.c (wait_to_start_job [Unix, UMAX]): Merged into one version
	under #ifdef LDAV_BASED.  Only loop while we have jobs running.
	Sleep for increasing amounts (increase one second per iteration)
	before checking the load average (after the first check).
	Get the load average from function load_average.
	(wait_to_start_job [not LDAV_BASED]): Always return.

	* make.c (die), remake.c (update_goal_chain), variable.c
	(expand_function: `shell'): Ditto.

	* load.c (load_average): Converted to wait_to_start_job.

	* remote.c: New file for remote execution functions.
	(start_remote_job_p): Return nonzero if the next job should be run
	remotely.
	(start_remote_job): Start a remote job and return an ID for it.
	(remote_status): Get status of dead remote children.

Fri Dec 16 16:51:07 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at hecuba.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (start_job): If start_remote_job_p () returns nonzero,
	call start_remote_job to start the job rather than fork and exec.
	(child_handler):

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Moved load average checking to
	start_job.

	* commands.c (child_handler: USG): Record the pid wait returns.

	* load.c (UMAX): Added some #include's needed for UMAX.

	* read.c (multi_glob), variable.c (string_glob): Ignore a (char **)
	-1 return from glob_filename.

	* variable.c (variable_expand): Make sure we don't increment past
	the end of the string we were passed.

	* variable.c (variable_expand): Terminate the expansion.

	* file.c (rename_file): If there is already a file under the new
	name, set its contents equal to FILE's (ick).

	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Pass all the args to
	define_variable when defining MAKELEVEL!

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): If max_load_average > 0, and
	we have children running, don't start up another child until the
	load average goes below max_load_average.

	* make.c: New variable `max_load_average'.
	(struct command_switch, decode_switches, decode_env_switches):
	Handle floating-point (double) args.
	(command_switches): Added `-l' switch to set `max_load_average'.

	* load.c (load_average): New file and function to return a double
	that is the current load average (1.00 scale).
	* GNUmakefile, oldMakefile: Pass flags in $(LOAD_AVG) for load.c.

Thu Dec 15 15:22:08 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Makefile: Renamed to oldMakefile.
	* GNUmakefile: Make Makefile from oldMakefile and depend.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): When putting the default makefiles in
	the read_makefiles chain so they will be remade, put them in the
	right order.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): If MAKEFILES is nonzero, always make
	in serial, and return as soon as one goal whose `changed' member is
	nonzero  is successfully remade.

	* commands.c (construct_command_argv): Added ` to sh_chars.

	* make.h: Don't declare construct_makeflags.

	* make.c (main): Set up MAKEFLAGS and MFLAGS and make an environment
	both before and after reading the makefiles, so the makefiles can
	use them and possible change them, and later children will get the
	right information.
	(construct_makeflags): Replaced with define_makeflags (static void),
	which defines the two variables.
	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Don't define MAKEFLAGS
	and MFLAGS.

Mon Dec 12 14:40:31 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.27.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Reset the handler to ourselves when
	called for USG, since it has no safe signals.

	* commands.c: For USG, use an int rather than a `union wait' for
	wait calls, and dissect it with bitmasks.
	(child_handler): No wait3 system call in USG.  Since we can't
	protect from hanging, always return immediately if we have no
	children we know about and we're not running a `shell' function.
	(There is still the danger of hanging waiting for a child that died
	without our being notified.)

	* remake.c: Include <fcntl.h> instead of <sys/file.h>.  What we need
	is really in <fcntl.h>, and while BSD <sys/file.h> includes
	<fcntl.h>, USG doesn't.

	* make.c (main): Figure out the program name before doing anything
	which might need it (in a call to error or fatal).

	* dir.c, glob.c: Use `struct dirent' and <dirent.h> for USGr3.

	* arscan.c (ar_scan): Added missing & before buf (which is an int)
	if SARMAG is not defined (SysV).

Fri Dec  9 18:44:13 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at pepper.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.26.

	* dir.c (find_directory, dir_file_exists_p): Keep track of how many
	directories we have open and don't let it be more than
	MAX_OPEN_DIRECTORIES (currently 10).

	* variable.c (expand_function: `foreach'): Use expand_argument
	rather than variable_expand so each repetition doesn't clobber the
	last!!!

Mon Dec  5 15:58:46 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at hecuba.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.25.

	* Makefile: Define `install' target.

	* GNUmakefile: Don't include GNUmakefile or depend in the
	distribution file.

Wed Nov 30 15:53:42 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Don't clobber a null into
	random storage if there were no $^ and/or $? words.

	* remake.c (check_dep): Set *MUST_MAKE_PTR nonzero if a dependency
	doesn't exist.

	* ar.c (ar_member_date, ar_touch): Make sure the modtime of the
	archive file itself is known before we fetch or change the modtime
	of one of its members.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Expand variable and function references
	before parsing rules so variable can contain special characters
	(colons and semicolons).

Sat Nov 26 11:36:31 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (expand_function: `filter', `filter-out'): Fixed so
	that filter-out works right.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `filter', `filter-out'): Made these
	functions use each word of their first argument as a pattern.

Fri Nov 25 10:51:47 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.24.

	* read.c (record_files): If a target is listed more than once in a
	single rule (that defines commands), give a warning message rather
	than the counter-intuitive message saying commands were already
	defined (in the same place).

	* make.c (fatal, error): Made them both take 6 args since there is
	at least one error message that need that many.  Too bad vfprintf is
	not universal!

	* Version 3.23.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Moved the construction of the `struct
	commands' into record_files.  Call record_files before recursing for an
	included makefile so the higher-up will determine the default goal.
	(record_files): Take arguments COMMANDS, COMMANDS_IDX and
	COMMANDS_STARTED and construct a `struct commands.

Thu Nov 24 14:36:33 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.22.

	* make.c (main): Made it a fatal error if we can't move back to the
	directory we started in before re-execing.

	* make.c (main): Get the current directory before doing anything
	else, so we know it even if we don't need it for the value of
	`MAKE', since we might want it when re-execing.

Wed Nov 23 13:34:44 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.21.

	* read.c (record_files): Eliminate duplicate deps in a chain.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `sort'): Pass the right number to
	qsort, not one less.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Always call notice_finished_file if
	FILE->command_state == cs_finished.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Call notice_finished_file to
	set FILE's status correctly when start_job fails (because it's out
	of commands or running under -n).

Fri Nov 18 15:31:12 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at saffron.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.20.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set the `update_status' of FILE to
	nonzero and set FILE's `updated' bit if we have decided to give up
	on remaking FILE because of errors in the dependencies.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Debugging messages use `dependency' (vs.
	`dependent') properly.

	* make.texinfo (Conditionals: Conditional Syntax): Function index
	entries for `ifndef' and `ifneq'.

	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Define `MAKELEVEL' to the
	decimal number of the makelevel, since it may be malformed or blank.

	shorter.

Thu Nov 10 16:51:36 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at basil.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.18.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Made it eat leading spaces and formfeeds
	(but not tabs), like it's documented to.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Let included makefiles determine the
	default goal, as is done by System V Make.

Tue Nov  1 19:03:08 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (new_environ): Don't increment VCNT when a variable is
	rejected.

Fri Oct 28 16:54:15 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at basil.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.17.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Don't use the same storage for a name
	in two rules since new_pattern_rule may free this storage when a
	rule is discarded.

	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): Undid useless change I made Oct 25.

Thu Oct 27 19:17:53 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* GNUmakefile, Makefile: Fixed a typo in a comment.
	* Makefile: Removed malloc.o from object file list.

	* variable.c: Removed old debugging #define's for xmalloc and
	xrealloc so non-ANSI cpp's won't barf.

	* make.c (main): Made local array for temp file name static so
	compilers that don't do auto aggregate initialization won't barf.

	* read.c: Removed static declaration of copy_dep_chain since it is
	no longer static.

Tue Oct 25 16:59:30 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at pepper.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): If we threw out the new rule because it
	matched an old one and OVERRIDE was zero, don't put the freed
	pointer in the chain!

Wed Oct 19 15:07:43 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at pepper.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.15.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `sort'): Don't do the sorting and
	writing out if there were no words in the first place.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Only fail with a "no way to make" message
	for a dependency (non-target) file.  If we don't know how to remake
	a target file, pretend it was successfully remade and is very new.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Don't increment `files_remade' for a
	non-target file we don't know how to remake.

	* read.c (record_files): Don't die with "both : and :: entries" for
	a file whose `is_target' flag is not set.

	second argument correctly.

	* ar.c (ar_touch): Return 1 rather than -1 for on errors.

Sat Oct 15 15:12:16 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.14.

	* GNUmakefile: Removed explicit rule for make.dvi since the built-in
	implicit rule now works.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Fixed .texinfo.dvi rule yet again
	so that it really works, now that parens are counted.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set FILE's `updated' flag after calling
	remake_file if it failed or finished immediately.

	* remake.c (update_file): Use the `updated' flag rather than the
	command state to decide if a file was fully considered, and
	therefore might give an "up to date" message.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made all functions that take more
	than one argument count parens of the appropriate flavor in their
	args and ignore commands nested in parens.

Fri Oct 14 18:35:00 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Pass second arg to read_makefile for

	built-in .texinfo.dvi implicit rule is screwed up.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Added a comment that the
	.texinfo.dvi rule does not work because of an ahem, feature of Make
	that at some point will be fixed--er, enhanced to alleviate this
	difficulty.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Fixed Texinfo -> DVI rule (again).

	* make.texinfo (Commands: Execution): Documented new competing for
	standard input among children.

	* commands.c (struct child): Added `good_stdin' flag to tell if this
	child has the stdin that doesn't point into nirvana.
	(good_stdin_used): New variable to tell if any child has the good
	standard input.
	(child_handler): Reset `good_stdin_used' if a dead child's
	`good_stdin' flag is set.
	(start_job): Give the new child the good standard input if
	`good_stdin_used' is no set, and set the child's `good_stdin' flag
	appropriately.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Changed Texinfo -> DVI rule to work
	better (I hope).

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Stop reading default makefiles after

	* read.c (read_makefile): Reset `reading_filename' and
	`reading_lineno_ptr' after recursing for an included makefile.

	files used for standard input makefiles.

	* make.c (main): Don't turn standard input into a broken pipe.

	* commands.c (start_job): Keep two extra file descriptors around: a
	good standard input, and a bad one that reads from a broken pipe.
	On the child side of the fork, if there are other children, give
	this one the broken pipe so they won't compete; if this is the only
	one, give it the good standard input.

	* make.h: Declare notice_finished_file.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Use noticed_finished_file
	after waiting for the child when there is only one job slot.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): New function to re-check mtime's
	and such things to be done when commands finish.
	(update_file_1): Use notice_finished_file.

	* commands.c (child_handler, execute_file_commands): Use new
	variable `job_slots_used' to record the number of jobs currently
	running, rather than diddling with `job_slots'.
	(execute_file_commands): Increment `job_slots_used' before calling
	start_job and decrement it on failure to avoid race condition.
	If there is only one job slot, wait for the child to finish and
	return its status so commands are run in linear order, as if there
	were no parallelism.

Wed Oct 12 15:59:03 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* file.h (struct file): Add `dontcare' member.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): When no default makefiles are found,
	put the names of all those tried in the `read_makefiles' chain so
	they will be updated if possible, giving their `struct dep's'
	`changed' members the value of 0 so we won't care if they cannot be
	found or remade.

	* make.texinfo (Makefiles: Remaking Makefiles): Documented that
	default makefiles will be remade if not found.

	directories, each containing a chain of `struct dirfiles', one for
	each file (real or impossible).

	named directory and return it (possibly creating a new one).
	(dir_file_exists_p): Read the directory on the fly if its stream is
	still valid (and ever was) if the file we're looking for is not
	already in the hash tables.

	Use the new directory/file scheme.

	* make.texinfo: Miscellaneous editorial changes and clarifiactions.

	on their `updated' flag, not their state.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't check for FILENAME being "-".
	(read_all_makefiles): Set each element of MAKEFILES to the name put
	in READ_MAKEFILES by read_makefile, since read_makefile may free the
	storage for the name it is passed, and someone might want to look at
	the elements of MAKEFILES again.

	* make.c (main): For each `-f' flag with arg `-' (standard input),
	read standard input into a temp file and pass the temp file's name
	to read_all_makefiles, after making sure it will not be remade.

	* make.c (construct_makeflags): Always put out `-j1'.

Sat Oct  1 00:19:59 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	spaces between them.

	* Version 3.10.

	* commands.c (wait_for_children): Don't check if `children' is nil.

	DIRNAME and filename "" if DIRNAME doesn't exist.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Return 0 after start_job

	* remake.c (remake_file): Set the state to `cs_finished' when not
	calling execute_file_commands.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Second arg is now MAKEFILES, nonzero
	meaning to disable -t, -q, and -n for each target unless the target

	added to the `read_makefiles' `struct dep' chain.

	Update read makefiles and re-exec self if they change.

	* remake.c (update_file): Make this function static.
	(update_goal_chain): New function to update a `struct dep' chain of
	goals, waiting until they are all finished before returning.

	* make.h: Don't declare update_file.  Declare update_goal_chain.

	* make.c (main): Call snap_deps, etc. that were in read_all_makefiles.

	chain of all makefiles read.
	(read_makefile): Now takes two args: FILENAME and TYPE, which is 0
	for a normal makefile, 1 for MAKEFILES variable or 2 for an included
	makefile.  Add a `struct dep' containing the name of the makefile
	(as it was found in the search path for type 2s), and TYPE in the
	`changed' member to the global `read_makefiles' chain.

	* make.h, rule.c (displace_pattern_rules,
	add_displaced_pattern_rules): Removed these functions.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Variable-expand the name of an `include'd
	makefile before calling find_makefile on it.

	* file.c (snap_deps): If the `struct file' for a `struct dep'
	already exists, free the `struct dep's `name' member before setting
	it to nil (since this info is in the `struct file').

	* read.c (copy_dep_chain): Made it copy each name rather than
	leaving multiple `struct dep's with the same pointers.

Thu Sep 29 19:08:13 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at catnip.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (decode_switches): Fixed second decode_env_switches call to
	use correct length of "MFLAGS" (6, not 5).

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't stop reading when readline returns
	zero lines read.  Only stop when the stream reaches EOF.  This makes
	it recognize the last line of a makefile without a newline.

	* remake.c (remake_file): If we don't know how to make FILE, set its
	command state to `cs_finished'.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't write the "up to date" message if

	for `commands' and `command_ptr' members.

	* make.c (decode_env_switches): Skip past an invalid letter (instead
	of looping forever).

	* commands.c (struct child): Add `environ' member to hold the
	environment for this child.
	(execute_file_commands): Get a new environment from new_environ and
	put in the the new `struct child's `environ' member.
	(child_handler): When freeing a child, free its `commands' member, the
	elements of its `environ' array and its `environ' member itself.
	(start_job): Set `environ' to the child's `environ' member before
	exec'ing the command.

	* variable.h, variable.c (new_environ): Made it return the new
	environment, not putting it in `environ'.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't give a "is up to date" message
	unless no files were remade and the state went from `cs_not_started'
	to `cs_finished', so repeat calls to finish jobs won't get the message.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Start up additional commands in a
	sequence after an ignored error.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't print "`foo' is up to date" messages
	when update_file_1 returns while commands are executing.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Pass the file name to name_mtime, not
	the bloody `struct file', dammit!!

	* commands.c (child_handler): Print out the "*** ..." error message
	when not under -i.  (I somehow forgot this.)

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Use name_mtime rather than file_mtime to
	re-get the mtime of a file whose commands have finished.

	* make.c (command_switches, decode_switches, decode_env_switches):
	Make all switches that take string args allow them right after the
	switch letter.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Check for a child being the `shell'
	function's command returning and set the global variable for
	expand_function to check.

	* variable.c (expand_function): For the `shell' function, instead of
	waiting for the child shell ourselves, let child_handler do it and
	loop around waiting for something to happen.

	* make.c (print_version): Made the copyright year static, not dynamic.

	* make.h, make.c: Remove construct_argv function.

	* make.c (main): Say "no goal target" instead of "no target".

	aren't killed by the first signal.

	* make.c (main), commands.c (kill_children): Decide between SIGCHLD
	and SIGCLD based on whether or not SIGCHLD is defined, not on USG.

	* Makefile: Link make with $(LOADLIBES).

	* read.c (construct_include_path): Fixed another bad xrealloc call.

	starting a new job to run file commands.

	* commands.c (start_job): Made it set the state to `cs_running'.

	appropriate, and reset the modtimes of the file and any `also_make'
	files it has.

	(switches): Added -j (job_slots).
	(construct_makeflags, decode_switches, decode_env_switches):
	Handle`positive_int'-type switches.

	* glob.c (glob_vector): Rename local variable `vector' to `VeCtOr'.
	This is said to avoid a conflict with some system's global `vector'
	variable.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made the `shell' function use
	construct_command_argv and do its own child control and piping.

	* make.c (main): Turn standard input into a broken pipe after
	reading in all makefiles (the last time it will be needed).

	* commands.c (struct child): Remove `pipe_fd' member.  We don't use
	pipes any more.
	(start_job): Return 0 for success, 1 or failure (rather than void).
	Don't use pipes.  Don't turn the child's stdin into a broken pipe.
	(child_handler): Print "*** Error" messages when necessary.

	`noerror' members to keep track of info about a command thread.
	(start_job): New function to start a job and update the argument
	`struct child' to reflect its status.
	(execute_file_commands): Merged run_file_commands back in.
	Made it use new start_job function.

	* rule.c (freerule): Don't free the `struct commands' of the
	discarded rule.  It may be used in more than one place.

	* commands.c (execute_command_line): Made it not try to delete the
	possibly partly-made file.  The child_handler function will do this.
	(fatal_error_signal): Ditto + call kill_children.

	* make.h: Declare job_slots.

	* make.c (main): Collect goals in a dep chain and run through this
	chain waiting for a child, eliminating finished goals, updating all
	remaining goals, and quitting if they fail and not -k.

	* commands.c (child_handler): If called with SIG < 0, - SIG is the
	max number of children to bury.

	* commands.c (child_handler): If called with SIG as zero,
	block waiting for running children.
	(kill_children): Call child_handler with zero rather than SIGCHLD.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Use the `command_state' member of FILE
	and its dependencies to determine what commands are running, what to
	do, etc.  If commands or dep commands are running when we are
	called, return success (0).  If commands finished since the last
	time we were called, return their status.

	* commands.h: Declare kill_children.

	* commands.c: Define `struct child' to keep track of child
	processes, with the chain in `children'.
	(child_handler): New function to catch child-termination signals
	(SIGCHLD, or SIGCLD for USG), store the returned status in the
	appropriate structure, take the now-obsolete `struct child' out of
	the chain, and free its storage.
	(execute_file_commands): Put all of the stuff invloving running the
	commands into new function run_file_commands.  Execute_file_commands
	now does process management for the commands, while
	run_file_commands (which is run in a subprocess) runs the commands.
	(kill_children): New function to kill all running children by
	sending them signal SIG.  If there are any children still living
	after they are all sent SIG, they are all sent SIGKILL.

	* make.c (main): Catch SIGCHLD (SIGCLD for USG) with child_handler.

	* commands.h: Declare child_handler function.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Check the `command_state'
	member of FILE and return 0 if it is `cs_running' or
	`cs_deps_running' and return the stored status if it is `cs_finished'.

	* file.h (struct file): Added `command_state' member.

	* commands.c (execute_command_line): Add `$' to the list of
	characters special to the shell.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Get the modtime of the makefile via a stat
	call so that a later file_mtime call won't do VPATH search for it.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't turn off -t and -q if the makefile
	was a command-line target.

	* make.c (main): Enter command-line targets as files and set their
	`cmd_target' members.

	* file.h (struct file): Added `cmd_target' member.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Temporarily turn off -t and -q while
	updating makefiles.

	* make.c (main): Don't use arg 0 from other_args (which is now
	argv[0]; i.e., the program's name).

	* read.c (read_makefile): Only return nonzero if commands were
	actually run to remake the makefile.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set FILE->updated to -1 if no commands
	were actually run (because no update was done or -t was given).

	bad args if it tried to expand other_args->list.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Made it not look at the `MAKE'

	* read.c (rerun_make): New function to re-exec make.

	* make.c (construct_makeflags, construct_argv): New functions to
	construct the `MAKEFLAGS' variable and to construct an arg list from
	parsed info.

	* read.c (read_makefile): New arg UPDATEIT, if nonzero, says to
	update the makefile as a target before reading it in.  When reading
	included makefiles, pass this as zero.  Now returns nonzero if the
	makefile was updated, zero if not.
	(read_all_makefiles): Pass a nonzero UPDATEIT arg to read_makefile
	for all default and -f makefiles and all makefiles from the
	`MAKEFILES' variable.  If any of the makefiles has changed, re-exec
	self to re-read them.

	* remake.c (update_file): Print a "File `foo' up to date'" message
	under -p.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Allocate one byte for each of

	the `struct file'.

	* read.c (record_files): If commands were specified twice, the error
	message specifies in what files and at what line numbers.

	* make.c (main): If any of the signals we usually fatal on were
	ignored by the parent (probably a shell), ignore them.

	* make.c (main): Print version info for -v, -p, or -d.
	(print_data_base): Don't print version info.  It will be done in main.

	* variable.c: Increased number of hash buckets to 257.

	* file.c: Increased number of hash buckets to 1007.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits): Moved comptation of
	`maxsuffix' to convert_to_pattern, since that function uses
	`maxsuffix', and must be called before count_implicit_rule_limits.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): If an existent (non-intermediate)
	dependendency was found via a terminal rule, set its
	`tried_implicit' flag, so it will never have implicit rule search done.

	* glob.c: Bug fix to avoid alloca(0).

	* arscan.c: USG and Sun386i fixes.

Thu Sep 15 19:40:26 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.texinfo: Documented `shell' function.

	* variable.c (expand_function): New function `shell', does
	backquote-style command expansion of its arg.

	* commands.c (execute_command_line): Second arg OUTBUF, if not nil,
	gets filled in with a malloc'd buffer containing the piped stdout of
	the command.
	(execute_file_commands): Use above (pass nil).

Mon Sep  5 17:03:49 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at hecuba.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Makefile: Added copyright notice.
	Added a comment about defining `NO_MINUS_C_MINUS_O' if necessary.

	* Version 3.05.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Don't pass `-o' switches with `-c'
	switches if `NO_MINUS_C_MINUS_O' is #define'd.

	* make.texinfo: Documented `GNUmakefile'.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Made it try default makefile
	`GNUmakefile' before others.

	* Version 3.04.

	* make.texinfo (Chained Rules): Added a @cindex about using
	.PRECIOUS to preserve intermediate files.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Made it not just return before executing

	* rule.c (default_pattern_rules, default_variables): Made it use
	`$(AR)' for `ar r' (to put files in archives).

	* vpath.c (build_vpath_lists): Made it recursively expand the
	`VPATH' variable (by using variable_expand instead of lookup_variable).

	* read.c (conditional_line): Made it not swallow whitespace after
	the comma in an `ifeq' using the `(a,b)' syntax.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits): Made it not crash if a
	pattern rule dep begins with `/'.

Sun Aug 28 15:51:12 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.texinfo: Clarified that the arg to the `origin' function is a
	variable *name*, not a reference.

	* make.texinfo: Clarified that both -Idir and -I dir are allowed.

Sat Aug 27 13:49:28 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (remake_file): Made touching phonies work right.

Wed Aug 24 20:40:48 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at nutmeg.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.texinfo: Removed reference to `RANLIB' variable.

	* Version 3.03.

	* make.c (collapse_continuations): Bug fix from RMS.

	* rule.c (install_default_pattern_rules): Made it set the
	`in_use' flag of the created rules to zero, rather than letting
	it be random garbage.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Fixed putting `also make' targets into
	file strucutres.

	* read.c (record_files): Fixed bug which made double-colon entries
	make it read off into space.

	* make.c (decode_switches): Made it understand `ignored' switches
	rather than dumping core.

Sun Aug 14 16:49:00 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (read_makefile): Made `include' filenames be
	variable-expanded.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Fixed an error message.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Made it accept ^L's as whitespace.
	* make.c (next_token, end_of_token): Ditto.

	* vpath.c (vpath_search): Fixed it so that the general VPATH (from
	the variable) is always checked, even if a selective VPATH (from a
	directive) matched the filename.

Sat Aug 13 14:20:46 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (decode_switches, main): Made the command switches be
	processed from a table of switches, variables, and types.  No
	functions are passed argc and argv any more.  They are passed arrays
	of strings they need to process.
	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Made it take an array rather than
	argc and argv.
	(construct_include_path): Ditto.

	* make.c (collapse_continuations): Made it work right (I hope).

	* make.texinfo: Minor editorial changes.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Minor speed improvement by freeing and

	unnecessary bcopy.

Thu Aug 11 00:10:43 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.texinfo: Fixed some unquoted @'s.

	* make.texinfo: Documented multiple-target pattern rules.
	Miscellaneous minor editorial changes and corrections.

	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Catalogue of Rules): Removed the list of
	variables.  That's what the next section is for.
	(Implicit: Implicit Variables): Made it agree with reality.

Wed Aug 10 00:55:39 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Fixed bug which made -p
	dump core.  (This was a really idiotic bug.)

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Fixed a bug which made it make the
	`also_make' member of the file in question nil if the first of
	the successful rule's targets was the matching one.
	Made it use only as much storage as necessary in the `also_make'
	member.
	(create_pattern): Made it use only as much storage as necessary in
	the `lens' and `suffixes' members of the created rule.

	* remake.c (library_file_mtime): Made it `static'.

	* file.c: Added a declaration for `errno', which is declared in some
	<errno.h>'s, but not all.

	* file.h (struct file): Added `also_make' member for multiple-target
	implicit rules.
	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it put the names of files updated by
	the given file's commands in its `also_make' member.
	* remake.c (update_file_1): Made it mark the files in a file's
	`also_make' member as updated when the file is updated.

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Fixed a bug which made it
	define a variable with the name of the whole definition when there
	was no space before the = or :=.

	* make.texinfo (Features): Made the changes which were made in RCS
	revision 2.7 but somehow lost since then.  Added -W.

Tue Aug  9 10:04:50 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.h: Added `o_default' to `enum variable_origin'.
	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Made it print the origins of
	the variables.
	* rule.c (install_default_pattern_rules): Made it define the default
	variables with origin `o_default'.

	* make.texinfo: Documented -W.

	* make.c (decode_switches, main): Added the -W flag to give files a
	time-stamp of now, for a `what if' effect when used with -n.

	* commands.c (print_commands): Made it say `(built-in)' for commands
	that are built into the default ruleset.

	* read.c (record_file): Made .SUFFIXES get its deps frontwards (again).
	* rule.c (set_default_suffixes, convert_to_pattern): Made it read
	.SUFFIXES's deps frontwards, so the converted rules will not be in
	reverse order.

	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): Fixed a bug wherein it would keep
	searching after it had removed a matching rule and ended up diddling
	with freed storage.

	* rule.c (freerule): Made it take the given rule off the chain.
	(new_pattern_rule, count_implicit_rule_limits): Use freerule to
	remove rules from the chain.

	* vpath.c (construct_vpath_list): Made it return after cleaning out
	all previous searchpaths when given a nil DIRPATH arg, so it won't
	go into the construction code and dump core dereferencing a nil
	pointer.

	* variable.c (patsubst_expand): Fixed a bug which made it not match
	correctly and sometimes dump core.

Mon Aug  8 16:35:48 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Made the .texinfo.dvi rule remove
	the files used in the comparison to determine whether or not a
	second TeX run is necessary.

	* make.texinfo: Fixed some overfull TeX hboxes.

	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Catalogue of Rules): Fixed a Texinfo error.

	* rule.c (create_pattern_rule): Fixed bug wherein index was not
	being passed its second arg.

	* read.c (getline): Merged back into readline.

	* rule.c (default_suffixes, default_suffix_rules,
	default_variables): Added .texinfo.info rule.
	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Catalogue of Rules): Documented
	.texinfo.dvi and .texinfo.info rules.

	* make.texinfo (Top): Changed `last updated' date to be correct (for
	the last time it was updated, not today).  Changed `for version
	3.00' since it's not going to be called that.

Sat Aug  6 19:51:10 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (print_commands): Added this function to print the
	contents of a `struct commands' for -p.
	* rule.c (print_rule_data_base): Use above.
	* file.c (print_file_data_base): Ditto.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits, new_pattern_rule,
	install_pattern_rule, print_rule_data_base): Made it understand the
	changed `struct rule' and act accordingly.
	(freerule): Added this function to free all the storage used by a rule.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it grok multiple targets of pattern
	rules.  The matching is done properly, but at present, only the
	matching pattern's target is used to give deps and commands.

Fri Aug  5 18:00:29 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (struct rule): Changed name, namelen, and patsuffix members
	to targets, lens, and suffixes, which are arrays, for multiple targets.
	(create_pattern_rule): Now takes first arg TARGETS, a nil-terminated
	array of targets, rather than a single target and patsuffix pointer.

	* read.c (record_files): If it finds an implicit pattern rule, it
	collects all the targets into an array and passes the whole thing to
	create_pattern_rule.  If there are non-pattern targets, it is a
	fatal error.

Tue Aug  2 15:06:38 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (readline): Split backslash-newline checking from reading
	and buffer-expanding.
	(getline): Created to do the reading and buffer-expanding formerly
	done in readline.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it reject nonterminal match-anything
	rules when a specific rule has matched, rather than rejecting
	terminal match-anything rules in this case.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Fixed a bug caused when the change to
	make it only recognize two-suffix rules whose target suffixes
	precede their dependency suffixes which made it work in the opposite
	direction (even worse than it started out).

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it reject nonterminal match-anything
	rules as intermediate targets when searching for both real and
	intermediate dependencies, rather than only when searching for
	intermediate ones.

Sun Jul 31 00:33:56 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Made it only recognize two-suffix
	rules whose target suffix comes before the dependency suffix in the
	.SUFFIXES list.

	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Made all automatic
	variables be defined with origin `o_automatic'.

	* variable.h: Added `o_automatic' to `enum variable_origin'

	* file.c (remove_intermediates): Made it not print an error message
	if the error was that the file does not exist.

	* rule.c: Removed `recursive' member from `struct rule'.

	* remake.c (library_file_mtime): Made it not use the directory hash
	functions, as reading in and hashing /usr/lib and /lib is slow and
	most likely unnecessary.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Changed message from ``No specification
	for making'' to ``No way to make'' so it will be short enough that
	most filenames will fit on a line.
	Made it look at the `recursive' member of the `struct commands',
	rather than of the `struct file' (which no longer has one).

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Made it look at the
	`recursive' member of the `struct commands', rather than of the
	`struct file' (which no longer has one).

	* file.h: Removed `recursive' member from `struct file'.

	* commands.h: Added `recursive' member to `struct commands'.

	* dep.h: Removed unused `quotedparen' member from `struct nameseq'
	and `struct dep'.

	* read.c (dequote): Removed this function.
	(multi_glob): Removed reference to `quotedparen' member of
	a `struct nameseq' and calls to dequote.

	* read.c (record_files): Made it set the stem for $* for all static
	pattern rules, not just those with commands given at that time.
	Removed check for recursive commands.
	Made it check for pairs of .SUFFIXES dependencies to reject as
	default goals as well as single ones (that don't start with dots).
	(read_makefile): Added checks for recursive commands to set
	the `recursive' flag in the `struct commands'.

Sat Jul 30 15:47:23 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (find_next_token): Made the LENGTHPTR arg optionally nil.

	* make.c: Removed `files_made' variable which is defined static in
	remake.c and used only there.
	(main): Cleaned up somewhat.
	(decode_switches): Cleaned up a bit.  Made an unknown option be a
	non-fatal error.
	(decode_env_switches): Made LEN arg unsigned.  Cleaned up.
	(print_version): Made it say ``see the source'' rather than ``see
	the source file'', since there is more than one.

	* file.h: Made `num_intermediates' declared unsigned.

	* file.c: Made `num_intermediates' variable unsigned.
	(remove_intermediates): Removed unused FORMAT arg.
	(enter_file): Made it handle double-colon files properly, adding the
	new entry as the old entry's prev pointer.

	* dir.c: Re-indented the `struct dir' definition to be right.
	(dir_load): Cleaned up slighty.
	(file_exists_p): Removed comment saying we could use `access', since
	that is a bad idea (except for setuid programs).  Cleaned up slightly.

	* commands.c: Changed some comments slightly.
	(execute_file_commands): Cleaned up a bit.  Changed some comments,
	added others.  Moved freeing of storage for $^ and $? to the same
	place as for the other automatic variables.
	(execute_command_line): Made `#' trigger a shell.
	Added some comments.  Cleaned up a bit.  Put all the special chars
	that trigger shells into an array easily changeable at the top.

	* ar.c: Added comments explaining each function.
	(ar_scan_1): Merged into ar_member_date.
	(ar_member_date): Changed call to ar_scan_1 to the body of that
	function.
	(ar_member_date_1): Simplified to a ?: expression rather than an
	if-else statement.
	(ar_member_touch): Changed error handling around a bit.
	None of these errors are fatal now.

	* variable.c (subst_expand): Added a new arg BY_WORD, to do substs
	only on full words.
	(patsubst_expand): Fixed bug which made calls whose patterns
	contained no `%' to not work correctly, by using above.
	(variable_expand): Pass extra arg to `subst_expand'.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Fixed bug which made `foreach' calls
	with one-word lists run off into never-never land.

Fri Jul 29 20:12:36 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made a very minor speed improvement
	by avoiding an unnecessary strlen call.

Wed Jul 27 16:01:47 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (default_suffixes): Rearranged the list somewhat; added
	`.el' and `.elc' to speed things up (especially when building
	Emacs), for the same reason `.h' is there.

	* read.c (record_files): Changed `lineno' from `long' to
	`unsigned int'.

Sun Jul 24 02:15:30 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (expand_function): Eliminated use of `wstok'
	because it is non-reentrant and unreliable.
	Fixed a minor bug which would cause something not to be freed.
	* make.c (wstok): Removed `wstok' because it is no longer used.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made `foreach' function put
	spaces between output texts like it's supposed to.
	
Sat Jul 23 17:32:55 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (default_suffixes, default_suffix_rules): Added rule
	to make %.dvi from %.texinfo.

	* dir.c (print_dir_data_base): Made it say a bit more.

Fri Jul 22 23:13:16 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (print_data_base): Split this function up into one
	for each thing.
	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): One of the above.
	* rule.c (print_rule_data_base): Ditto.
	* file.c (print_file_data_base): Ditto.
	* dir.c (print_dir_data_base): Ditto.

	* rule.c (install_pattern_rule): Fixed a bug which caused the
	terminal and recursive flags to always be zero for rules
	entered by this function.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Double-colon): Added a paragraph
	explaining the purpose of double-colon rules.

	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Catalogue of Rules): Updated to
	reflect new C++, TeX, Web, and Texinfo rules.  Other slight
	editorial changes.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Fixed a bug wherein
	random memory could get written for files with no deps.
	
Wed Jul 20 19:30:31 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (readline): Fix bug wherein it would not recognize a
	backslash-newline if the buffer filled up and was enlarged
	right before reading the newline.
	
Tue Jul 19 19:55:02 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at chilli.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c: Added default suffix rules for .cc (using $(C++),
	which defaults to `g++', and $(C++FLAGS)), .tex, .dvi, .web
	and .cweb (using $(TEX), $(WEAVE), $(TANGLE), $(CWEAVE) and
	$(CTANGLE)).
	
Sat Jul 16 21:24:28 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Made error formats use %u rather than %ld for line numbers,
	which are now unsigned int's rather than long's.

	* read.c (conditional_line): Fixed some bugs caused by use of
	unsigned int rather than int in one place.

	* read.c (conditional_line): Put the info about active
	conditionals in a struct.
	(read_makefile): Make a new struct of info about conditionals
	for included makefiles and restore the old one after the
	included makefile has been read.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't try to read a makefile with
	name "" after giving an error message because an `include'
	directive gave no filename.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Give an error message for
	non-whitespace text after the filename in an `include' directive.

	* make.c (error): Take five args, like `fatal'.  It managed to
	lose with only two.  Is there a better way to do this without vfprintf?

	* read.c (read_makefile): Commands consisting of only
	whitespace are not the same as no commands.  I thought I'd
	fixed this bug months ago; it seems to have come back.

	* make.c (collapse_continuations): All whitespace around a
	backslash-newline combination is turned into a single space.

	* Added COPYING file and copyright notices to all files.

	* make.texinfo (Running: Goals): Fix a typo.

	* read.c (do_define): Take an arg for the origin of the
	variable being defined.
	(read_makefile): Grok `override define'.

	* make.texinfo (Variables: Override Directive, Defining):
	Document the `override define' combination directive.

	* ar.c (ar_member_date): Make a 0 return from `ar_scan' return
	(time_t) -1 (nonexistent file), rather than (time_t) 0, which,
	when put in the `struct file', makes `file_mtime' try to get
	the mtime over and over again.

	* variable.c (pattern_matches): Fix a bug that made patterns
	not beginning with `%' never match.
	
Fri Jul 15 21:01:44 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Took Make out of RCS.

	* Split the monolithic `make.c' into several smaller files.
