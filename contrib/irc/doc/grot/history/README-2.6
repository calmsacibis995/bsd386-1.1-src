To install the new server, there is just a few changes to be made.

      (APOLLO: Be sure to have NEED_INET_NETOF, NEED_INET_ADDR and
       NEED_INET_NTOA undefined.)

      Comment: I just found that compiling on our SUN SPARC with GCC produces
      code that dumps core.. (that might not happen on your machine, try it,
      we may have out-of-date libraries). See netnews gnu.gcc.bug for a dis-
      cussion about the matter. It seems that gcc passes struct's in a
      different manner.

* Server configuration

  Edit the include/config.h to your hearts content, avoiding going
  beyond the warning line, unless you are *absolute* sure you know
  what you are doing.
  If you happen to not take to this warning, you may end up with
  a server that will not function properly and annoy not only you,
  but users all around the world.

  Old irc client can be found in this package and if you want to use it,
  check Makefile in directory irc before compiling. There are other,
  better irc clients in distribution and the client distributed with
  this version is simply something to begin with if you don't happen
  to have other clients available.

  This version was brought to you by jto@tolsun.oulu.fi and send any
  bug fixes and suggestions to me.

NOTE: This server does *NOT* have MAIL system installed by default.
      The reason is that it doesn't work with many systems.

This version introduces you string channels, starting with
a plus (+) sign. The first person joining a string channel
claims it's ownership and after that is entitiled to use /mode
command. Ownerships can be given and taken away with
/mode <channel> +o <nickname>  and /mode <channel> -o <nickname>
Other flags are: s - secret, p - private, l - limited, i - inviteonly.
                 m - moderated, n - no private messages to channel,
                 t - topic settable by operator only
New command /KICK <channel> <user> kicks a user off channel.
