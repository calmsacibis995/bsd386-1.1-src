 * limits the number that you actively reach out to connect to.

 * to have a backup link, then sometimes you end up connected to both
 * your primary and backup, routing traffic between them. To prevent
 * this, #define MAXIMUM_LINKS 1 and set up both primary and
 * secondary with C:blah::blah:6667 lines. THEY SHOULD NOT TRY TO
 * CONNECT TO YOU, YOU SHOULD CONNECT TO THEM.
 *
 * Gateways such as the server which connects Australia to the US can
 * do a similar thing. Put the American nodes you want to connect to
 * in with C:blah::blah:6667 lines, and the Australian nodes with
 * C:blah::blah lines. Have the Americans put you in with C:blah::blah
 * lines. Then you will only connect to one of the Americans.
