The change implemented here is that the operator password in irc.conf
is no longer stored in plaintext form, but is encrypted the same way
that user passwords are encrypted on normal UNIX systems. Ie, instead
of having

	O:*:goodboy:Nelson

in your ircd.conf file, you have

	O:*:sCnvYRmbFJ7oI:Nelson

You still type "/oper Nelson goodboy" to become operator. However, if
someone gets ahold of your irc.conf file, they can no longer figure
out what the password is from reading it.  There are still other
security holes, namely server-server passwords, but this closes one
obvious problem.

So how do you generate these icky looking strings for passwords?
There's a simple program called mkpasswd to do that for you.  Just run
mkpasswd, and at the prompt type in your plaintext password.  It will
spit out the encrypted password, which you should then just copy into
the irc.conf file. This should be done only when adding new passwords
to your irc.conf file. To change over your irc.conf file to use
encrypted passwords, define CRYPT_OPER_PASSWORD in config.h. You will
need to recompile your server if you already compiled it with this
feature disabled. Once compiled, edit the Makefile in this directory
and chang "IRCDCONF" to your irc.conf file. Then "make install" in this
directory to replace all the operator passwords in your irc.conf file
with the encrypted format.

Choose your passwords carefully. Do not choose something in a
dictionary, make sure its at least 5 characters. Anything past 8
characters is ignored.

One thing to note about crypt() passwords - for every plaintext, there
are 4096 different passwords. Some valid encryptions of "goodboy"
include t1Ub2RhRQHd4g sCnvYRmbFJ7oI and Xr4Z.Kg5tcdy6. The first
two characters (the "salt") determine which of the 4096 passwords
you will get. mkpasswd chooses the salt randomly, or alternately
will let you specify one on the command line.
