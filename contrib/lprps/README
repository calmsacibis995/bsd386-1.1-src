This is lprps version 2.5.

lprps is a collection of programs for using lpr with a PostScript
printer connected by a bidirectional serial channel.  It has been
tested mainly with Suns running various versions of SunOS (4.0.3, 4.1
and 4.1.1).  It should be easy to port to other 4.3 BSD based systems.
It is not intended for use with System V.

It contains the following programs:

lprps	handles communication with the printer
psif	allows separate filters to be used for text and PostScript
textps	simple text to PostScript filter
psrev	PostScript page reversal filter
psof    banner filter

The file lpr.diff contains some changes to the version of lpr in the
second Berkeley networking release; lprps does not require these
changes, but will work slightly better with them.

Some features are:
 
* Deals intelligently with output generated by the printer: printer
  errors (such as ``out of paper'') are logged using syslog; other
  errors and output generated by the user's job are mailed back to the
  user.  Updates status file (displayed by lpq) with printer's current
  status.

* Performs printer accounting.

* Ensures that the printer is ready to receive the job.

* Determines whether file is PostScript or text (by looking at the
  first 2 bytes), and uses the appropriate filter; this is done in
  such a way that you can easily use your favourite text-to-PostScript
  filter.

* Can automatically perform page reversal for the benefit of printers
  that stack face-up.

* Can easily add your own output filters for TeX, troff or any of the
  other formats supported by lpr.

* Page reversal filter supports version 3.0 of Document Structuring
  Conventions.

* Text to PostScript filter supports ISO Latin-1.

* Supports banner printing.

There is no copyright on lprps.

See the file INSTALL for installation information.

Please report any bugs to me.
