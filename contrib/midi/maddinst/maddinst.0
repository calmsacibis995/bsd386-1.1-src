       maddinst  - Add/change instruments in a MIDI file on a per
       track basis

       Used without arguments, mmaaddddiinnsstt  reads  a  standard  MIDI
       format  [  SMF  ]  file  data  from stdin, and inserts the
       appropriate MIDI commands at the begining of each track to
       select  the  specified  voicing.   Any existing instrument
       selection commands for the specified tracks  are  removed.
       A  SMF file with the changes made is sent to stdout.  If a
       midi-file is specified on the command line, that  is  used
       in place of stdin.

       The  informations  on  the tracks and instruments are con-
       tained in the instrument-file.  The format of this file is
       one  line for each track to be modified.  Each line should
       contain the following fields  separated  by  white  space:
       track number, channel number and instrument (voicing) num-
       ber.  The track number specifies a track  in  the  SMF  (0
       being  the  first).  The channel number is the channel the
       instrument change command will be sent on (0  -  15),  and
       the  instrument  number  is  the  instrument  you  wish to
       select.  Any thing else on  the  line  after  these  three
       fields will be ignored.  Comments should have a '#' in the
       first column.

BBUUGGSS
       Currently, maddinst will not do multiple  instruments  per
       track.  This would be useful in type 0 SMF files.
