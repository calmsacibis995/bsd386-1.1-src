.SH NAME
maddinst \- Add/change instruments in a MIDI file on a per track basis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B maddinst
instrument-file
[
midi-file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Used without arguments,
.B maddinst
reads a standard
.SM MIDI
format [
.SM SMF
] file data from stdin,
and inserts the appropriate
.SM MIDI
commands at the begining of each
track to select the specified voicing.
Any existing instrument selection commands
for the specified tracks are removed.
A
.SM SMF
file with the changes made is sent to
stdout.
If a midi-file is specified on the command line,
that is used in place of stdin.
.LP
The informations on the tracks and instruments
are contained in the instrument-file.
The format of this file is one line for each track to be
modified.
Each line should contain the following fields separated by
white space: track number, channel number and instrument (voicing)
number.
The track number specifies a track in the
.SM SMF
(0 being the first).
The channel number is the channel the instrument change command
will be sent on (0 - 15),
and the instrument number is the instrument you wish to select.
Any thing else on the line after these three fields will be
ignored.
Comments should have a '#' in the first column.
.SH BUGS

Currently, maddinst will not do multiple instruments per track.

files.
