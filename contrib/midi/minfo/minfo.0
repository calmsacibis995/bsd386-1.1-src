       Used without arguments, mmiinnffoo reads standard MIDI format [
       SMF  ]  files from stdin, and print to stdout all informa-
       tion in the files as human readable text.  If one or  more
       midi-files  are  specified  on  the command line, they are
       used in place of stdin.

       -TT     In conjunction with its argument, this option spec-
              ifies  which  tracks  should  be  read from the SMF
              files.  The track-list should be  a  list  of  non-
              negative integers separated by either `-'s or `,'s.
              Commas  denote  individual  tracks,  while   hyphen
              denote  an  inclusive range of tracks.  The default
              is to use all tracks in all files.
