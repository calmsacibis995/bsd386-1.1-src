README for: "psgraph" version of 21 February 1992

"Psgraph" takes input files vaguely like those accepted by graph(1),
and produces PostScript output.  The manual page explains the rest.

Psgraph was written by Chris Kent of DECWRL (now Chris Kantarjiev
of Xerox PARC), based on some code from Bob Brown of NASA RIACS,
and has been hacked on by Brian Reid and Jeff Mogul of DECWRL.

Bug reports may be sent to "psgraph-bugs@decwrl.dec.com", but
we don't promise to respond or to fix anything.

Please obey the part in the LICENSE file that says not to redistribute
this software to anyone, unless you do it for free and include the
LICENSE file and all copyright notices.

To install psgraph, you might have to modify Makefile and psgraph.h
to reflect where you want to install the files.  In psgraph.h,
the important line is:
#define PROLOG  "/usr/local/lib/ps/psgraph.pro"

To obtain another copy of the code (in case someone updates the
code later on):
        ftp gatekeeper.dec.com
        user anonymous
                <give your name when asked for the password>
        cd pub/DEC
        type binary
        get psgraph.tar.Z
then "uncompress psgraph.tar.Z", cd to an empty directory where
you want to put the sources, and "tar xf psgraph.tar".

The psgraph program is known to work on
	Ultrix (Vax and MIPS hardware), using standard Ultrix compilers
	SunOs, using Sun's compilers
