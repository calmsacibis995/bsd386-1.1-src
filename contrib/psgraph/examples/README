This directory contains examples of some input files for "psgraph".
You should ignore the scientific content of these examples, since
they may be incorrect or even sheer fabrications.

Some examples might look better when printed on a color PostScript
printer, or viewed using a PostScript previewer on a color display.

Type "make" to generate a bunch of .ps files.  (You might have to
change the definitions in the Makefile for PSGRAPH and PSGSIMP).
Some of these might take a long time to print, even on a fast printer.

The file shorter.plot is automatically generated from long.plot using
psgsimp, to demonstrate how this program can simplify a graph (making
it much faster to print) without removing significant detail.
