Here is a brief synopsis of the applications included with the BSD
Sound Blaster Pro device driver, version 1.4 (June 12, 1992).

xmix/xmix
    An X Windows interface to the SB Pro mixer, using faders and such.

cdsp
    A program to set/read the DSP speed and stereo settings.

chew
    A simple program for converting between signed to unsigned byte
    formats.  (csound uses and produces signed byte files; the SB wants
    unsigned bytes.

filt
    A skeleton MIDI filter to read incoming MIDI data, possibly
    modifies the bytes, and then sends them out the MIDI-OUT port.

float
    A program to convert between unsigned bytes and floating point binary
    streams.  Floats are used by several phase vocoders and such.

mixer
    A command-line interface to the mixer.  Similar to the bundled DOS
    program SBP-SET.

notes
    Generates random notes in the FM channels.  Not very useful, but it's
    great for testing the driver, and it shows what a wide range of sounds
    can come from those simple FM synth chips.

playmidi
    Reads a standard MIDI type 1 or type 0 file and sends the data out the
    MIDI port.  Mostly useful for playing .mid files to an external MIDI
    synthesizer.

record
    Simplifies recording direct to disk.  You tell it how long, what
    speed, and what file to record into.

midi2fm
    Experimental program to play incoming MIDI notes on the FM synth
    chips.  (Note that I play a horn, so polyphonics are probably not
    supported properly.)
        
revox
    Reverses binary sound files of any length.  

midithru
    Pass MIDI bytes from MIDI-IN to MIDI-OUT.  Handy when you need it.
