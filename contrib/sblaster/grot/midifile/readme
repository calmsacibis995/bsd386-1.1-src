This directory contains a library of code to read and write standard 
MIDI files, a standard as defined by the MMA, the MIDI Manufacturer's
Assocation. The format spec is available from the IMA:

                International MIDI Association
                5316 West 57th Street
                Los Angeles, CA 90056


"make mftext" will compile a program that gives a verbose textual
listing of a MIDI file, and is an example of how to read a file.  "make
mf1to0" will compile a program that demonstrates how to write midi
files, and converts format 1 multitrack files to format 0.  "make
midifile.man" will produce a formatted manual page.  Example MIDI files
are named "example*.uu".  They're uuencoded; "make uutomid" will
uudecode them all.  The first two examples (example1 and example2) are
the examples given in the 0.06 version of the standard MIDI file
specification.

Notes on Porting:
This library was written on UNIX, and tested on Sun's, PC's and Mac's.  
It is distributed in a raw vanilla state, which means you may have to do a 
little editing depending on the requirements of your particular development 
system.  For instance, with THINK C on the Mac, you have to be careful 
and include all the include files needed by their implementation of 
UNIX calls such as malloc().  I've left in the proper calls ifdef'd on
THINK so you'll have a clue what to do.
