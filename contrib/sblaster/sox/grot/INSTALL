SOX: Sound Tools installation

May 18, 1992

The sox program is just a batch utility that reads & writes
files.  It's very easy to port to new computers.

This distribution will compile and run on most Unix systems.
It was developed on a Unix/386 machine running AT&T V.3.2.
It has been ported to many AT&T V.3- and V.4-flavored Unixes,
and many BSD-derived Unixes as well.  There is a DOS port,
and VMS and Amiga ones are on the way.

For V.3 and V.4 Unix, the Makefile should work as is.
For SUN, NeXT, and other Unixes derived from Berkeley Unix,
you'll need to comment out these four lines in the Makefile:
	
	CFLAGS    = $O -DSYSV 
	CC        = cc
	AR        = ar r
	RANLIB    = ar ts

and uncomment the following ones:

	# CFLAGS    = $O 
	# CC        = cc
	# AR        = ar r
	# RANLIB    = ranlib

After successfully compiling SOX, try translating a sound file.
If you can play one of the supported sound file formats,
translate 'monkey.voc' to your format (we'll use 'xxx'):

	sox monkey.voc monkey.xxx

You may have to give the word size and rate for the file.
For example, this command will make a sound file with a data rate of
12,500 samples per second and the data formatted as signed shorts:

	sox monkey.voc -r 12500 -s -w monkey.xxx 

If monkey.xxx plays properly (it's a very short monkey screech),
congratulations!  SOX works.  Now you should run the 'tests.sh'
shell script to exercise various test scenarios.  It should
print nothing out.  You can only run this script under Unix.
It shows alternate uses of the (far too) many options to sox.

After testing with a sound file, try compiling sox with the
optimizer (-O instead of -g).  It should run a little faster.
