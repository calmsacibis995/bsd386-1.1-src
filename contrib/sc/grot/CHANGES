David Bonnell
	-scqref [will produce] TROFF output instead of plain text, 
	 [when] you define QREF_FMT=TROFF in the Makefile.

	 build with something like:
		scqref > quickref
	 	troff -ms quickref > quickref.ps
Kurt Cockrum
	- sc.h:
		If not (defined(BSD42) || defined(BSD43) && !defined(ultrix)),
		include <memory.h> for the benefit of some USG systems...
	- screen.c:
		Repaired cpp logic:
		don't mention IDLOKBAD or idlok() unless SYSV3 defined;
		idlok() does not exist for USG pre-SYSV systems (may exist for
		SYSV{2,3,4}).
	- tutorial.sc:
		Repaired a number of off-by-1 errors.
Mats Wichmann
	-cleaned up Robert E. Cousins MIF format support code which is
		compatible with FrameMaker.

	-'-D' vs '-S' was needed on a XENIX2_3 line [""]
	-'quit()' -> 'doquit()', function conflict [""]
	-change xmalloc,xrealloc,xfree -> scxmalloc,scxrealloc,scxfree

David Fox - added a date format so that columns whose values are the number
	of seconds since 1/1/70 will be displayed as dates in the format
	dd-mmm-yy, and a modification to the grammar so data entered in the
	format dd_mm_yy will be converted into the number of seconds since
	1/1/70.
	COMMANDS ADDED: f # # 3
Teus Hagen
	- labels are centered strings
	- constant strings with '\' preceeding character will
	  be wheeled over the column width

	- added autolabeling
		'When there is an empty cell to the left of a cell that has
		just been defined (with /d), a label is created in the blank

		created.  This labeling is only done for definitions of single
		cells (and not for ranges).'
		'The feature can be turned on and off with a toggle (^T)
		command'
Petri Wessman
	- Added support for SLaTeX, 'a Scandinavian version of LaTeX, in
		intensive use ... in Finland and in Sweden'
Jeff Buhrt
	- vmtbl.c explictly set arrays of pointers to NULL, vs memset()
	- psc   [-P] plain numbers only:a number only when there is no [-+eE]
		[-S] all numbers are strings
	- psc: a number must end in [0-9.eE] anything else makes it a string

	- psc: made sure we grow enough when we call growtbl()
	- cleaned up the Makefile w/ a few suggestions
	- SIGWINCH is delt with next time the screen would update (testing)

*	- added $(name)qref to print a Quick Reference card
	- got rid of INVALIDS that may have been left around
*	- pressing return on a empty line puts you into insert mode
		(like in <=Sc6.1). When entering you can also press ESC
		to go into the editor (no change); this is also documented
		now so it might stay around this time.

CHANGES BETWEEN 6.11 and 6.10

Jonathan I. Kamens
	- sc.doc now mentions the tutorial file in the FILES section
Andy Fyfe
	- pointed out 3 locations where a NULL should have been '\0'
Robert Bond
	- pointed out the ERROR could hide a cellerror
Piercarlo Grandi
	- H,J,I,K now move 1/2 screen

		the type of every character in a curses window.
		- Added KEY_BACKSPACE to nmgetch
		- strtof ifdef

Jim Clausing
	- made sure / doesn't try to divide by zero.
Tom Kloos
	- correction to substr() example in help.c
Piercarlo "Peter" Grandi
	- Disable non-constant expressions while loading
	- Added extra code in dealing w/ floating point exceptions
	- #ifdef'd SAVENAME (vs hardcoded SC.SAVE) to allowing changing the
		emergency save name.
Casey Leedom
	- Makefile changes: man extension, RINT note, make values should
		never be left undefined and then referenced, don't leave
		around *.old's
Tom Anderson
	- patches to add type of column format (note format now has 3 args)
Jeff Buhrt
	- xmalloc/xfree fatal() will now call diesave()
		(MAKE SURE the saved file is ok if this were to happen)
	- history[] is now a circular queue, this will cut down on the
		number of data moves and also xmalloc/xfree calls
		(idea from Keith Bostic)
	- cells with an error (ex: divide by 0) will show 'ERROR'
	- you can 'goto error' (or 'goto') to find an ERROR (for next ERROR)
Robert Bond
	- When in numeric mode the ^B, ^F, ^N, ^P key will end a numeric entry.

CHANGES BETWEEN 6.9 and 6.8

Jim Richardson
	- pointed out vi mode was not documented in sc.doc
	- found a nasty buffer limit bug in savedot()
	- a side effect was ^D could cause a core dump (-Jeff)
Tim Wilson
	- Hints on compiling on Ultrix
Eric Putz
	-patch for printfile() (sc died on huge # of columns in a W)
Jeffrey C Honig
	-patch for lex.c which bombed on SunOS 4.1 if $TERM was not set
Tom Kloos
	-psc now calls [+-.] strings vs numbers.
	-also pointed out a format reversal problem
Jack Goral
	-changes to Makefile to compile under SCO Unix V rel 3.2.0
Mark Nagel
	-changes to allow arbitrarily complex formatting of cells 
Kim Sanders
	-^W generated an incorrect equation (line was not started at beginning)
Mike Schwartz
	-a put command will use the same encryption key as when the
	file was read.
	>I have a suggestion for making the encyrption option of "sc" more
	>usable:  Right now, if you use the -x option when you start up sc, it
	>prompts you for the key (just like "vi -x" does).  But when you try to
	>write the file out using the Put command, it asks for the key again
	>each time.  Why not make it use the same key you used before (as "vi
	>-x" does)?  That would really help, because as it is, each time you try
	>to save the file you run the risk of mistyping the key.
	>
	>You might think this causes a security problem, since the key is then
	>an argument to crypt, and hence is visible from ps.  But when crypt
	>runs, the first thing it does is to copy the key to an internal buffer
	>and then zero out the argv copy, so the window of vulnerability is
	>vanishingly small.
Adri Verhoef
	- pointed out a ^D caused a core dump (fixed)
Gene H. Olson
	- format now grows the spreadsheet before setting the column format.
	- removed an extra ';' that caused a possible column number trashing
Paul Eggert
	-sc now also has round-to-even, also known as ``banker's rounding''.
	>With round-to-even, a number exactly halfway between two values is
	>rounded to whichever is even; e.g. rnd(0.5)=0, rnd(1.5)=2,
	>rnd(2.5)=2, rnd(3.5)=4.  This is the default rounding mode for
	>IEEE floating point, for good reason: it has better numeric
	>properties.  For example, if X+Y is an integer,
	>then X+Y = rnd(X)+rnd(Y) with round-to-even,
	>but not always with sc's rounding (which is
	>round-to-positive-infinity).  I ran into this problem when trying to
	>split interest in an account to two people fairly.
	-While we're on the subject, @round(X,Y) should also work when Y
	>is negative. For example, @round(123,-2) should yield 100.


CHANGES BETWEEN 6.8 and 6.7

Jeff Buhrt (with help from some beta testers-Thank you)
	  1) added a per row memory allocation
		-runs in about 1/2 run time and 1/3 the space of 6.6vm.1
		-insert/delete row now just moves pointers (# == maxrow+1-currow)
			and blanks one row (of columns (maxcol))
		-as the number of cells grows the size is more linear
			(no more ##Meg images except for 100,000's of rows....)
		-row to column pointer translation is done by a macro (ATBL)
			that returns a pointer to the cell pointer.
			*ATBL would be a pointer to a *ent (cell).
		-the maximum # of columns is limited by ABSMAXCOLS or
			sizeof(struct ent *)*maxcols (whichever is smaller)
			(702 * 4 = 2808 is no real limit even for 286 large model)
		-the maximum # of rows is limited by the virtual memory limit or
			sizeof(struct ent **)*maxrows (whichever is smaller)
			(4*X=64k, X=16384 rows (excluding malloc overhead) on
				a '286 large model. Even w/ 3.25Meg and 10Mhz)
			(plus of course any memory used for cells)
	2) dolookup (int vs double)
	3) dolookup calling eval w/ ent * not enode *
		 (dolookup called w/ ent * not enode *)
	4) cleaned up a lot of .... *x = 0 to  (.... *)0 (cmds, interp)
	5) psc: fwidth/precision were reversed on the output
	6) Backup copy (on save) using same mode to [path/]#file~
		 (will prompt if a backup fails)
	7) put y/n prompt function into yn_ask(mesg)
	8) found a move(x,y) in sc -> move(y,x) and only move when needed
	9) we use FullUpdate || changed (to see if ANY cells changed) 
		before trying to redraw the screen in update
		(now we don't try to redraw every time a key is hit)
		-if we are stand[ing]out we do not create a cell just to force a
		 standout inside the repaint section of update()
		-only draw blank cells if we cleared it or it is standing out
		reason: the less work (what to update) curses has to do, the faster
			a screen update will be (less cpu required)
	14) {insert, delete}col replaced w/ {open,close}col(currow, numcol_to_insert)
		(limits looping)
	6.7.1.1
	15) goto nonexistant cell may loop
	16) make sure that startup size will at least fill the screen w/ cells.
	17) added version.c
	6.7.1.2
	18) When we would normally die w/o saving (SIGQUIT, etc), we now ask
		if people would like to save the current spreadsheet.
		If 'y', saves to the current file name, otherwise ~/SC.SAVE,
		then /tmp/SC.SAVE if all else fails.
	6.7.1.3
	19) don't use malloc.c for production code
	20) progname is now truncated to just the basename (systems w/ long paths
		caused problems)

		Also affects order of traversing regions in /f and /r
	 User setting of automatic or manual recalculation.
	 User setting of number of times to try recalculation.
	 + and - commands when in non-numeric mode to do 
		increment and decrement operations.
	@index, @stindex, @atan2, @lookup  functions.
	Save/restore options.
	Support for TeX, LaTeX, and better support for tbl in "T" cmd.
	Provision of a copyent function to copy entries (same code repeated
		in several locations)

       Added the mod operator "%"
       New help functions.
       Constant prescale "$"
       Added string matching to @lookup.
       Some more bug fixes.
       Testing, integration, documentation.

Alan Silverstein-
	Greatly revised the manual entry.
	Added menus for ^E command and row/column commands, which
	involved a bunch of code cleanup.

	Changed top row display to clearly indicate string labels
	versus number parts, and to distinguish string functions from
	constant labels.

	When the character cursor is on a cell (not topline), ^H
	(backspace) is like ^B (move back one cell), rather than being
	ignored.

	When the character cursor is on a cell (not topline), ^I (tab)
	is like ^F (move forward one cell), rather than being ignored.
	^R is no longer identical with ^L.  Now ^R highlights all cells
	which should be entered by a user because they contain constant
	numeric values (not the result of a numeric expression).

	Added a ^X command, similar to ^R, which highlights cells which
	have expressions.  It also displays the expressions in the
	highlighted cells as left-justified strings, instead of the
	label and/or value of the cell.

	Added indirection functions (@nval() and @sval()) for simple
	table lookups.  Given a column name and row number, they return
	the numeric or string value of the selected cell.

	Added external functions (@ext()) for non-trivial
	computations.  Given a command name and argument, it calls the
	command and reads back one output line.

	Added a ^T,e command to toggle enabling of external functions.

	Changed ^T,t to only control the top line display, and added
	^T,c to control current cell highlighting.  (Separated the
	functions.)

	"!" (shell escape) gives a vi-style warning if there were any
	changes since the last write.  (No change to manual entry.)

	Fixed some startup, error, and prompt messages to be cleaner
	and/or more consistent.  (No changes to manual entry.)

	Fixed a bug:  If @substr() upper bound (third parameter) is
	past the end of the string operand, return the substring
	through the end of the string, rather than returning a null
	string.

	Fixed a bug:  Reset SIGINT to default after forking before
	calling shell escape program and before starting pipeline (for
	commands which support this).  Didn't reset SIGINT before
	calling crypt and external functions because in both cases it
	should be irrelevant.  (No change to manual entry.)

CHANGES BETWEEN 6.1 and 6.2:


Chris Cole-
