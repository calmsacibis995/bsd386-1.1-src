.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm te
.Op filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm te
is an implementation of TECO written in C.
.Pp
.Nm te
implements DEC standard TECO, with some exceptions
described below, plus some extensions.
.Pp
.Nm te
assumes a VT100-type terminal, and its display
driver is hard-coded for such.
.Sh DOCUMENTATION
.Pp
The DEC Standard TECO book describes the basic editing
functions of TECO.
.Sh FILES
.nf
~/.tecorc		editor startup file
<file>.tmp	temporary output file(s)
<file>.bak	previous version of edited file
/usr/share/misc/termcap

.Sh BUGS
.Pp
te acquires memory for its buffer using malloc(), but
never returns the space.  This can cause the task in
memory to appear to be larger than it is.
.Pp
Several of the standard display features of TECO, most
notably the -256+n:W command used by interpretive editing
macros, are unimplemented.  There are undoubtedly some
subtle bugs in the display handler for the features that
are implemented.
