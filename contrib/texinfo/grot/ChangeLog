        * New Version 2.7 Beta.

        * info/echo_area.c: Numerous functions now do something with the
        numeric argument.  Kill ring implemented, as well as yank and

Mon Dec 28 17:33:12 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/filesys.c, info/nodes.c: New member of FILE_BUFFER "FILESIZE"
        contains the size of file_buffer->contents.  finfo.st_size is no

        function (filesys_read_info_file) can read compressed files.

        * info/filesys.c (info_find_fullpath) If a file starts with a slash (or
        tilde expansion causes it to start with a slash) still call
        info_find_file_in_path () on it so that we can find files with
        compression suffixes.

        the current window; without an arg, move to the center line.
        * infomap.c: Put move_to_screen_line () on `M-r'.

        * info/nodes.c (adjust_nodestart): Don't set N_UpdateTags unless the
        node came from a tags table.

        * info/nodes.c (info_find_file_internal): If the filename being looked
        for doesn't start with a `/', then additionally compare the
        filename against the fullpath of the file buffer sans the
        directory name.  This can happen when selecting nodemenu items.

        * info/session.c, info/display.c: Remove all references to
        active_window_ch, active_window_cv, cursor_h, and cursor_v.  The

        * info/nodemenu.c: New file implements a few functions for manipulating
        previously visited nodes.  `list-visited-nodes' produces a menu of
        the nodes that could be reached by info_history_node () in some
        window.  `select-visited-node' is similar to `list-visited-node'
        followed by `info-menu-item', but doesn't display a window with
        the visited nodes menu.

        * info/session.c (info_numeric_arg_digit_loop): If redisplay had been
        interrupted, then redisplay all of the windows while waiting for
        input.

        * info/display.c (display_was_interrupted_p): New variable keeps track
        of interrupted display.  Used in
        info/session.c:info_numeric_arg_digit_loop ().

        * info/session.c (info_global_next, info_global_prev): Use the numeric
        argument passed to determine how many nodes to move.

        * info/session.c (info_scroll_forward, info_scroll_backward): If the
        invoking key is not SPC or DEL only do Page Only scrolling.

Thu Dec 17 01:34:22 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/display.c (display_update_one_window): Allow W_NoWrap to affect
        window display.

        * info/window.c (calculate_line_starts): Now takes a WINDOW * as an
        argument, and simply does the calculation, placing the results
        into window->line_starts and window->line_count.  It also handles
        W_NoWrap in window->flags.

Mon Dec 14 02:18:55 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/session.c (info_backward_scroll): Don't try to get previous node

        "window_scroll_step" to attempt to control the amount which the
        window scrolls.

        * info/m-x.c (info_variables) Add "scroll-step" to the list.

Thu Dec 10 08:52:10 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/m-x.c: New variable entry show-index-matches.  When set to
        non-zero the matched portion of the search string is indicated

        * info/echo_area.c (ea_possible_completions): Always build completions
        before checking to see how many there were.

        * info/info-utils.c: (info_concatenate_references): New utility
        function concatenates references.

        * info/Makefile.in: Add indices.c and indices.h to SRCS and HDRS.
          Add indices.c to CMDFILES.

        commands of info, and provides index searching capabilities.

        * info/echo_area.c (info_read_completing_in_echo_area):  Split off into
        separate callable function info_read_completing_internal ().

        info_read_completing_internal () with non-forcing argument.

        * info/session.c: Rename down_next_upnext_or_error () and
        prev_up_or_error () to forward_move_node_structure (), and
        backward_move_node_structure ().  Implement new commands
        info_global_next () and info_global_prev ().

        * info/infomap.c (initialize_info_keymaps): Bind `[' and `]' to
        backward_, forward_move_node_structure () respectively.

        * info/session.c (info_menu_digit): Called with "0" as arg, select the

        * info/terminal.c (terminal_insert_lines, terminal_delete_lines) Do not
        expect tgoto to return a new string; it returns the address of a
        static buffer.

        * info/infodoc.c (info_find_or_create_help_window) Correct check for
        prior existing help node.

        * info/m-x.c (set_variable): Allow variables to have a list of choices.
        Add new variable scroll-behaviour.

        * info/session.c (down_next_upnext_or_error, prev_up_or_error) New
        functions implement user-controlled behaviour when attempting to
        scroll past the bottom or top of a node.  New variable
        info_scroll_behaviour is user visible as "scroll-behaviour".

        * info/session.c (info_scroll_forward, info_scroll_backward) Call new
        functions for user-controlled scroll behaviour.

        * info/terminal.c (terminal_initialize_terminal) Set PC from BC not

Sat Dec  5 00:07:59 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/info.c: New option "--subnodes" says to recursively dump the
        menus of the nodes that you wish to dump.  Menu items which point

Thu Dec  3 16:11:02 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/session.c (info_error) Don't ring the bell if
        info_error_rings_bell_p is zero.  (info_abort_key) Ring the bell
        if printing "Quit" in the echo area wouldn't do it.

        * info/m-x.c (set_variable) New functions allows setting of
        variables in the echo area.  Currently, only visilble-bell and
        errors-ring-bell are implemented.

Wed Dec  2 13:11:37 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/nodes.c, info/makedoc.c: If O_RDONLY is not defined by

        * info/filesys.c (info_file_in_path): Expand leading tildes found
        within directory names.

        * info/terminal.c (terminal_initialize_terminal) Set ospeed to 13 if
        not settable any other way.  It is an index into an array of
        output speeds.

        * info/display.c (free_display) Do not free a NULL display.

        * info/display.c (string_width): New functions returns the width of

        last/first page of the node, and the last command was
        forward/backward, do info_next/prev/_node.

        * info/session.c: New function info_select_reference_this_line gets
        menu or cross reference immediately.

        * info/infomap.c (initialize_info_keymaps): Add info_keymap[LFD] to
        invoke info_select_reference_this_line ().

        * info/session.c (info_last_reference) Rename to
        info_history_reference.  Wrote info_last_reference, and
        info_first_reference which go to the last or first node of an info
        file.

Fri Nov 27 00:59:02 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        Makefile variable NAMED_COMMANDS (set to -DNAMED_COMMANDS).

        * info/window.c (window_new_screen_size) Rewrite from scratch, allowing
        clean growth and shrinkage of the screen.  New variable
        window_deletion_notifier is a pointer to a function to call when
        the screen changes size, and some windows have to get deleted.
        The function is called with the window to be deleted as an
        argument, and it should clean up dangling references to that
        window.

        * info/session.c (initialize_info_session): Set
        window_deletion_function to forget_window_and_nodes.

        * info/display.c (display_update_one_window): If the first row of the
        window to display wouldn't appear in the_screen, don't try to
        display it.  This happens when the screen has been made
        unreasonably small, and we attempt to display the echo area.

Tue Nov 24 00:47:20 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * Release Info 2.2.

        * info/session.c: New functions implement reading typeahead and
        implement C-g flushing typed ahead characters.
        (info_search_internal): allows C-g to exit multi-file searches.

Mon Nov 23 01:53:35 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/nodes.c: Remove calls to sscanf (), replacing them with calls to
        atol (), since that is much faster.
        (get_nodes_of_tags_table) Only check for "(Indirect)" if we
        haven't parsed any nodes out of the tags table.  Increase the
        amount that file_buffer->nodes grows to 100 from 50.  These two
        together sufficiently speed up the parsing process.

        * info/nodes.c: info_get_node_of_file_buffer_tags (),
        info_get_node_of_file_buffer_nodes (): Search the appropriate list
        and return a node.  This was simply a cut and paste edit to
        functionalize the code.

        * info/TODO: Remove suggestion for partial tag parsing, since tag
        parsing is much faster now.

Sat Nov 21 02:48:23 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/infomap.c: Install info_isearch (on C-s) and
        info_reverse_isearch (on C-r) for Info windows.

        * info/session.c (incremental_search, info_isearch,
        info_reverse_isearch) New functions implement incremental
        searching.

Fri Nov 20 00:01:35 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/terminal.c (terminal_initialize_terminal): Declare and set up
        `ospeed'.  Turn off C-s and C-q processing.

        * info/session.c (info_show_point) When this function is called, the
        desired result is to show the point immediately.  So now it calls
        set_window_pagetop () if the new pagetop is not the same as the
        old one.  This means that info_prev_line (), info_next_line (),
        info_forward_word (), and info_backward_word () can all scroll the
        window if they have to.

Thu Nov 19 12:27:07 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/session.c (set_window_pagetop): Add scrolling to make this
        faster.

        * info/echo_area.c (push/pop_echo_area): Remember the list of items to
        complete over.

        nodelen, only to nodelen - 1.

        * info/display.c: New function display_scroll_display () scrolls the
        rmembered display as well as the text on the actual display.

        * info/terminal.c: New functions terminal_scroll_terminal (),
        terminal_scroll_down (), and terminal_scroll_up ().  All
        implemented using "al" and "dl" termcap capabilities. (i.e.,
        insert and delete line).

Wed Nov 18 15:05:14 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

        * info/termdep.h: Only define HAVE_FCNTL_H if !aix and !ultrix.

        * util/texi2dvi (-D): debugging option renamed from '-d'. 
        Made check to enable debugging more terse.
        When checking if index files have changed, use
        variable $this_file instead of $file in for loop.
        (file_texi): wherever the variable $file was used to reference
        the texinfo file, substituted $file_texi. 

Sat Oct 17 07:30:34 1992  Brian J. Fox  (bfox@helios)

        * util/texindex.c: Remove references to USG replacing them with a
