# tk_dialog:
#
# This procedure displays a dialog box, waits for a button in the dialog
# to be invoked, then returns the index of the selected button.
#
# Arguments:
# w -		Window to use for dialog top-level.
# title -	Title to display in dialog's decorative frame.
# text -	Message to display in dialog.
# bitmap -	Bitmap to display in dialog (empty string means none).
# default -	Index of button that is to display the default ring
#		(-1 means none).
# args -	One or more strings to display in buttons across the
#		bottom of the dialog box.
