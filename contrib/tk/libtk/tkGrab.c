/*
 * This module is ridiculously complicated... sorry about that.  The
 * problem is that the grabs provided by the X server aren't very
 * useful, so this module tries to create a more useful form of grab
 * using the X server's rudimentary facilities.  This requires us to
 * suppress some of the events coming from the X server and generate
 * many additional events.  Managing the events is hard because of the
 * asynchronous way that the event queue is processed.  The current
 * solution uses an extra "grab event queue" for each display, where
 * we put the event that we synthesize here.  Events in this queue
 * are processed before any events in the normal X queue.  The grab
 * event queue is needed (rather than just pushing events back on the
 * X queue) so that we can keep a clear boundary between the events
 * we've synthesized and those coming from the server, so that we can
 * add new events after all the other synthesized events but before
 * those from the server.

     *    things like menus work, where button presses outside the
     *    grabbed menu need to be seen.  An application can always
     *    ignore the events if they occur outside its window.
     * 3. If a button press or release occurs outside the window where
     *    the first button was pressed, retarget the event so it's reported
     *    to the window where the first button was pressed.
     * 4. If the last button is released in a window different than where
     *    the first button was pressed, generate Enter/Leave events to
     *    move the mouse from the button window to its current window.
     * 5. If the grab is set at a time when a button is already down, or

     *    dispPtr->buttonWinPtr will stay NULL.  Just forget about the

     *    window contains the pointer.  If this window isn't in the grab
     *    tree then redirect events to the grab window.
     * 6. When a button is pressed during a local grab, the X server sets
     *    a grab of its own, since it doesn't even know about our local
     *    grab.  This causes enter and leave events no longer to be
     *    generated in the same way as for global grabs.  To eliminate this
     *    problem, set a temporary global grab when the first button goes
