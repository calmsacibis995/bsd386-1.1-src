Tk Test Suite
--------------

This directory contains a set of validation tests for Tk.
Each of the files whose name ends in ".test" is intended to
fully exercise one or a few Tk features.  The features
tested by a given file are listed in the first line of the
file.  The test suite is nowhere near complete yet.  Contributions
of additional tests would be most welcome.

You can run the tests in two ways:
    (a) type "make test" in the parent directory to this one; this
        will run all of the tests.
    (b) start up tktest in this directory, then "source" the test
        file (for example, type "source pack.test").  To run all
	of the tests, type "source all".
In either case no output will be generated if all goes well, except
for a listing of the tests.  If there are errors then additional
messages will appear.

For more details on the testing environment, see the README
file in the Tcl test directory.
