	From Thorsten Ohl <ohl@physics.harvard.edu>:
	* wdiff.c (split_file_into_words): Call tmpnam just before opening
	the file.  On the Next, successive calls to tmpnam will return
	different values only if the file is opened in between.
	(main): Allocate temp_name statically, and initialize it to "".
	On certain systems, tmpnam(NULL) causes a segmentation violation.
	Length will be L_tmpman or else, PATH_MAX+1 from pathmax.h.  Check
	temp_name before unlinking, in case of an intervening signal.
	* pathmax.h: New, from elsewhere.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute pathmax.h, adjust dependencies.

Wed Nov 18 09:28:12 1992  Jim Meyering  (meyering@idefix.comco.com)

	* Makefile.in: Add another layer of double quotes so PAGER
	and DIFF may contain spaces.  Before, with PAGER='less -i'
	compilation failed with unterminated string.

	From James Ganong <jeg@ced.berkeley.edu>:
	* collatew.el: New, generalizes Emacs LISP `compage-windows'.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute collatew.el.

Tue Aug 18 03:57:06 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Version 0.03 released to alt.sources and ftp.uu.net:/tmp.

	* Makefile.in: Correct check goal to ignore error from wdiff.

	* unproto.l: New, from ~/src.  Note that flex is required.

	* Makefile.in: Add U, apply unproto to wdiff.c and version.c if
	not __STDC__.

	subdirectories.

Mon Aug 17 14:00:03 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* configure.in: Check for improper `const' support.

	* wdiff.c: Insure exit code values: 0 if no differences found, 1
	if any difference found, 2 for other reasons or errors.  Execute
	`diff' even in the case absolutely no output will result.

	* wdiff.c: Removed spurious comma after last enum item.

	* alloca.c: New, from other GNU sources.
	* configure.in: Check for alloca.

Sun Aug 16 09:28:50 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* wdiff.c (usage_and_exit): Added -s description.

Sat Aug 15 09:27:31 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Version 0.02 released to alt.sources and ftp.uu.net:/tmp.

	* wdiff.c: Added -s option to produce statistics at end of output.

	* wdiff.c: Copy common code from the left side instead of the
	right side if only the common code and deleted words are wanted;
	this makes the output spacing nicer.  Also, correct a bug by which
	added words were shown as common code for this option set.

	* wdiff.c: PAGER_PROGRAM was previously defaulted to "more", it is
	now left undefined.  As currently set, the auto-configurator will
	pick one, however, and force it into the program.

	* wdiff.c: Avoid all emphasis if all of the output would be
	emphasized the same way.

	* wdiff.c: Avoid overstriking whitespace unless the pager is less.

	* wdiff.c: Do termcap initialization and completion strings.  If a
	pager is used, insure they are sent to stdout, never to the pager.

	* wdiff.c: If PAGER is defined, but to the empty string, avoid
	using any pager, instead of using a default PAGER.

Fri Aug 14 19:22:30 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* wdiff.c: Remove the `signal (SIGCLD, SIG_IGN);' which is a
	System V-ism, and rather wait() explicitely.

	* wdiff.c: Declare tgetstr if <termcap.h> not included.

	* Makefile.in: Have check goal works, now that -d is gone.

Wed Aug 12 01:01:37 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Version 0.01 released to alt.sources and ftp.uu.net:/tmp.

	* wdiff.c(setup_signals): Do not intercept SIGQUIT.

	* wdiff.c: Automatically pipe through `more' or `less' if writing
	to terminal, using environment variable $PAGER to override PAGER
	definition.  Force terminal mode, but if the pager is `less', use
	printer mode.  Modify copy_whitespace for overstriking whitespace
	with itself in printer mode: `less' understands this.
	* strstr.c: Borrowed somewhere from GNU.
	* writepipe.c: New, provided by David Mackenzie.
	* configure.in: Try defining PAGER to less or more.  Also use our
	strstr if necessary.
	* Makefile.in: Transmit PAGER to program.  Also handle strstr.c.

	* configure.in: Try defining DIFF to gdiff or diff.
	* Makefile.in: Transmit DIFF to wdiff.c, which handles it already.

	* wdiff.c: Options -wxyz renamed from old -1234.  New options -123
	acting a little like in GNU comm utility, old -d option deleted.

	* wdiff.c: Check for HAVE_TPUTS instead of HAVE_TERMCAP_H in many
	places.
	* configure.in: Use -ltermlib on LIBS for Xenix, -ltermcap
	otherwise; once this done, test for `tputs' availability.

	* COPYING.LIB: New.
	* Makefile.in: Distributing COPYING.LIB.
