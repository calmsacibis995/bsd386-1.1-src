These are more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Check how wdiff.dvi prints.

* Implement a clever combination of these two ideas: (1) have a wpatch
program (Zhuo Zang <zzang@stat.ufl.edu>, 1992-08-13); (2) use unified
diff format (Per Cederqvist <ceder@lysator.liu.se>, 1992-11-22).

* Detect and configure termcap better.

* Support systems with terminfo and without termcap.

* Select by options exactly what is whitespace.

* Merge some spiff features into wdiff.

* Merge all of wdiff into GNU diff.
