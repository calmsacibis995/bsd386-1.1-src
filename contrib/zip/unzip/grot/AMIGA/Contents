Notes:  Paul Wells' original Amiga port for SAS/C and Lattice C (I think)
was subsequently modified for another compiler (probably DICE by Georg
Sassen), and possibly no longer compiles under the original compilers.
The suspect code is in file_io.c and has to do with Paul's _TZ code, which
is presently commented out and replaced by a specialized SetFileDate call.
The file patch.pw will give you some idea of how the code originally looked.
Presumably all three compilers have predefined macros which identify them,
so there need not be any conflict; but there may be one at the moment.

Note also that the DICE compiler version does not require either of the
two source files included here, and that none of the Amiga stuff has been
tested since UnZip 4.1.
