All material in this sub-archive was provided by Martin Schulz.
Unfortunately, his patches against v4.1 arrived just as v4.2 was 
released as a final "feature-freeze" beta, too late to incorporate.
Since the files for UnZip have changed considerably between ver-
sions--in particular, unzip.c, extract.c and file_io.c--the patches
provided here will fail miserably.  We will, however, see what we
can do to incorporate most of them before v5.0.

The non-Atari patches mentioned in Martin's readme file are not
included here.  Both the Unix blanks patch and the symbolic links
patches are no longer necessary (actually, there is a bug in the
existing symbolic links code--it won't do compressed links properly
--but this is a rare problem); the optimization patch is on hold
but will probably be incorporated in v5.0 as well, assuming it
doesn't break any other systems.
