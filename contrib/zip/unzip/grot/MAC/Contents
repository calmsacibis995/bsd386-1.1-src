Contents of the MAC sub-archive for UnZip 5.0 and later:

  Contents                this file
  macfile.c               Macintosh filesystem code
  macstat.c               Macintosh stat() emulation
  macstat.h               header file for stat() emulation
  aztec.make              MPW makefile for Aztec C (binary)
  mpw.make                MPW makefile for MPW C (binary)
  thinkc.hqx              Think C project file (BinHex)
  thinkc.rsrc.hqx         resource file for Macintosh unzip (BinHex)

The makefiles are marked "binary" because they contain a few special
characters (which look a lot like D's and 6's under Unix).  They're
basically readable, but e-mailing them without protection is likely
to strip the high bit off these characters, rendering the makefiles
less than useful.  Be forewarned...

The Think C files are BinHexed because they contain Mac resource forks
in addition to the ordinary data forks (or maybe they only contain re-
source forks...whatever).  While Zip 1.9 and UnZip 5.0 can save/restore
such information, it's not too helpful to make use of this feature until
everyone *has* UnZip 5.0.  Also, there's no way to store such information
in a .tar.Z file, for instance.  Both of the .hqx files must be converted
with BinHex 4.0 (or later).
