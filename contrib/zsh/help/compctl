     compctl [ -cfhovbCD ] [ -k name ] [ arg ... ]
          Control the editor's completion behavior  when  one  of
          arg  is the current command.  With the -D flag, control
          default completion behavior for commands  not  assigned
          any  special behavior; with -C, control completion when
          there is no current  command.   The  remaining  options
          specify  the type of command arguments to look for dur-
          ing completion.  For example,  compctl  -hf  rlogin  is
          equivalent to hostcmds=(rlogin).
          -c   Expect command names.
          -f   Expect filenames and filesystem paths.
          -h   Expect hostnames taken from the $hosts variable.
          -o   Expect option names.
          -v   Expect variable names.
          -b   Expect key binding names.
          -k name
               Expect names taken from the elements of $name.
