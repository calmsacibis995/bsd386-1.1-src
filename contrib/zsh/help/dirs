     dirs [ -v ] [ arg ... ]
          With no arguments, print the contents of the  directory
          stack.   If  the  -v option is given, number the direc-
          tories in the stack  when  printing.   Directories  are
          added to this stack with the pushd command, and removed
          with the cd or popd commands.  If arguments are  speci-
          fied,  load  them  onto  the directory stack, replacing
          anything that was there, and push the current directory
          onto the stack.
