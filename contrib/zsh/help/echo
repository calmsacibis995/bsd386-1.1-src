     echo [ -n ] [ arg ... ]
          Write each arg on the standard  output,  with  a  space
          separating  each  one.   If the -n flag is not present,
          print a newline at the end.  echo recognizes  the  fol-
          lowing escape sequences:
          \b   backspace
          \c   don't print an ending newline
          \e   escape
          \f   form feed
          \n   newline
          \r   carriage return
          \t   horizontal tab
          \v   vertical tab
          \\   backslash
          \xxx character code in octal
