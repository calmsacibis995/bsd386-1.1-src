     kill [ -sig ] job ...
     kill -l
          Sends either SIGTERM or the  specified  signal  to  the
          given  jobs  or processes.  Signals are given by number
          or by names (with the prefix "SIG"  removed).   If  the
          signal  being  sent  is  not KILL or CONT, then the job
          will be sent a CONT signal if it is stopped.  The argu-
          ment  job can be the process id of a job not in the job
          list.  In the second form, kill -l,  the  signal  names
          are listed.
