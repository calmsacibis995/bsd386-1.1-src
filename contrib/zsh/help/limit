     limit [ -h ] [ resource [ limit ] ] ...
     limit -s
          Limit the  resource  consumption  of  children  of  the
          current  shell.   If  limit is not specified, print the
          current limit placed on  resource;  otherwise  set  the
          limit to the specified value.  If the -h flag is given,
          use hard limits instead of soft limits.  If no resource
          is given, print all limits.

          resource is one of:

          cputime
               Maximum CPU seconds per process.
          filesize
               Largest single file allowed.
          datasize
               Maximum data size (including stack) for each  pro-
               cess.
          stacksize
               Maximum stack size for each process.
          coredumpsize
               Maximum size of a core dump.
          resident
               Maximum resident set size.
          descriptors
               Maximum value for a file descriptor.

          limit is a number, with an optional scaling factor,  as
          follows:

          nh   hours.
          nk   kilobytes. This is the default for  all  but  cpu-
               time.
          nm   megabytes or minutes.
          mm:ss
               minutes and seconds.
