     print [ -RnrslzpNDP ] [ -un ] [ arg ... ]
          With no flags or with flag -, the arguments are printed
          on the standard output as described by echo.
          -R, -r
               ignore the escape conventions  of  echo.   The  -R
               option  will  print  all  subsequent arguments and
               options.
          -s   place the results in the history list  instead  of
               on the standard output.
          -n   do not add a newline to the output.
          -l   print the arguments separated by newlines  instead
               of spaces.
          -N   print the arguments separated  and  terminated  by
               nulls.
          -un  print the arguments to file descriptor n.
          -p   print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.
          -z   push the arguments onto the editing buffer  stack,
               separated  by  spaces;  no  escape  sequences  are
               recognized.
          -D   treat the arguments as directory names,  replacing
               prefixes with ~ expressions, as appropriate.
          -P   recognize the same  escape  sequences  as  in  the
