     read [ -rzp ] [ -un ] [ name?prompt ] [ name ...  ]
          Read one line and break it into fields using the  char-
          acters  in  IFS as separators.  In raw mode, -r, a \ at
          the end of a line does not signify  line  continuation.
          If  the  -z  flag  is  set, read from the editor buffer
          stack.  The first field is assigned to the first  name,
          the  second  field to the second name, etc., with left-
          over fields assigned to the  last  name.   If  name  is
          omitted  then REPLY is used.  If -un is specified, then
          input is read from file descriptor n; if -p  is  speci-
          fied,  then input is read from the coprocess.  The exit
          status is 0 unless end-of-file is encountered.  If  the
          first argument contains a ?, the remainder of this word
          is used as a prompt on standard error when the shell is
          interactive.   The  exit  status is 0 unless an end-of-
          file is encountered.
