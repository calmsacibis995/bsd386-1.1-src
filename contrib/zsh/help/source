     source file [ arg ... ]
     . file [ arg ... ]
          Read and execute commands  from  file  in  the  current
          shell  environment.   If file does not contain a slash,
          the shell looks in the components of path to  find  the
          directory  containing  file.   If any arguments arg are
          given, they become the positional parameters;  the  old
          positional  parameters  are  restored  when the file is
          done executing.  The exit status is the exit status  of
          the last command executed.
