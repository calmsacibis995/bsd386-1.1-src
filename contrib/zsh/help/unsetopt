     setopt [ +-options ] [ name ... ]
          Set the options for the shell.  All  options  specified
          either  with flags or by name are set.  If no arguments
          are supplied, the names of all  options  currently  set
          are  printed.   In option names, case is insignificant,
          and all underscore characters are ignored.
     unsetopt [ +-options ] [ name ... ]
          Unset the options for the shell.  All options specified
          either with flags or by name are unset.

     The following options may be  set  upon  invocation  of  the
     shell, or with the set or setopt builtins:
          ALLEXPORT (-a)
               All parameters subsequently defined are  automati-
               cally exported.
          AUTO_CD (-J)
               If a command is not in the hash table,  and  there
               exists  an executable directory by that name, per-
               form the cd command to that directory.
          AUTOLIST (-9)
               Automatically list choices on an ambiguous comple-
               tion.
          AUTOMENU
               Automatically use menu completion if the  TAB  key
               is pressed repeatedly.
          AUTO_PUSHD (-N)
               Make cd act like pushd.
          AUTO_RESUME (-W)
               Treat single word simple commands without redirec-
               tion  as  candidates for resumption of an existing
               job.
          BGNICE (-6)
               Run all background jobs at a lower priority.  This
               option is set by default.
          BRACECCL
               Allow brace expansions of the form {a-zA-Z}, etc.
          CDABLEVARS (-T)
               If the argument to a cd command is  not  a  direc-
               tory,  but  a  parameter  exists  by the same name
               whose value begins with a /, try to change to  the
               directory specified by the parameter's value.
          CHASELINKS (-w)
               Resolve symbolic links to their true values.

          CORRECT_ALL (-O)
               Try to correct the spelling of all arguments in  a
               line.
          CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS
               Allow loop bodies to take  the  form  "list;  end"
               instead of "do list; done".
          CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES
               Complain if a quoted expression runs off  the  end
               of  a  line;  prevent quoted expressions from con-
               taining unescaped newlines.
          CSH_NULL_GLOB
               If  a  pattern  for  filename  generation  has  no
               matches,  delete  the  pattern  from  the argument
               list; do not report an error unless all  the  pat-
               terns  in  a  command  have no matches.  Overrides
               NULLGLOB.
          ERREXIT (-e)
               If a command has a non-zero exit  status,  execute
               the ERR trap, if set, and exit.
          EXTENDED_GLOB
               Treat the # and ^ characters as part  of  patterns
               for filename generation, etc.
          GLOB_COMPLETE
               Like MENU_COMPLETE, except that the  current  word
               is  expanded  using normal shell expansion instead
               of completion.  If no matches are found,  a  *  is
               added  to  the  end  of the word, and expansion is
               attempted again.
          GLOB_DOTS (-4)
               Do not require a leading . in  a  filename  to  be
               matched explicitly.
          HASH_CMDS
               Place the location of each  command  in  the  hash
               table  the  first  time  it  is executed.  If this
               option is unset, no path hashing will be  done  at
               all.
          HASH_DIRS
               Whenever a command is executed, hash the directory
               containing  it,  as  well  as all directories that
               occur earlier in  the  path.   Has  no  effect  if
               HASH_CMDS is unset.
          HASH_LIST_ALL
               Whenever a command completion is  attempted,  make
               sure  the  entire  command  path  is hashed first.
               This makes the first completion slower.
          HIST_IGNORE_DUPS (-h)
               Do not enter command lines into the  history  list
               if they are duplicates of the previous event.
          HIST_IGNORE_SPACE (-g)
               Do not enter command lines into the  history  list
               if they begin with a blank.
          HISTLIT (-j)
               Use literal (unparsed)  versions  of  the  history
               lines in the editor.

               Remove the history (fc -l) command from  the  his-
               tory when invoked.
          HIST_VERIFY
               Whenever the user enters a line with history  sub-
               stitution,   don't   execute  the  line  directly;
               instead, perform history substitution  and  reload
               the line into the editing buffer.
          IGNORE_BRACES (-I)
               Do not perform brace expansion.
          IGNOREEOF (-7)
               Do not exit on end-of-file.  Require  the  use  of
               exit or logout instead.
          INTERACTIVE (-i)
               This is an interactive shell.
          INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k)
               Allow comments even in interactive shells.
          KSH_OPTION_PRINT
               Alters the way options settings are printed.
          LIST_TYPES (-X)
               When listing files that are possible  completions,

               fying mark.
          LOGIN (-l)
               This is a login shell.
          LONG_LIST_JOBS (-R)
               List jobs in the long format by default.
          MAIL_WARNING (-U)
               Print a warning message if a mail  file  has  been
               accessed since the shell last checked.
          MARKDIRS (-8)
               Append a trailing / to all directory names result-
               ing from filename generation (globbing).
          MENU_COMPLETE (-Y)
               On an ambiguous  completion,  instead  of  listing
               possibilities,  insert the first match.  Then when
               completion is requested again,  remove  the  first
               match  and  insert  the  second  match, etc.  When
               there are no more matches, go back  to  the  first
               one  again.   reverse-menu-complete may be used to
               loop through the list in the other direction.
          MENU_COMPLETE_BEEP
               Beep on an ambiguous menu completion.
          MONITOR (-m)
               Allow job control.  Set by default in  interactive
               shells.
          NO_BAD_PATTERN (-2)
               If a pattern  for  filename  generation  is  badly
               formed,  leave  it  unchanged in the argument list
               instead of printing an error.
          NO_BANG_HIST (-K)
               Do not perform textual history  substitution.   Do
               not treat the ! character specially.
          NOBEEP (-B)
               Do not beep.
          NO_CLOBBER (-1)
               Prevents > redirection  from  truncating  existing
               files.  >! may be used to truncate a file instead.
               Also prevents >> from creating files.  >>! may  be
               used instead.
          NO_EQUALS
               Don't perform = filename substitution.
          NOEXEC (-n)
               Read commands and check them  for  syntax  errors,
               but do not execute them.
          NOGLOB (-F)
               Disable filename generation.
          NO_HIST_BEEP
               Don't beep when an attempt is  made  to  access  a
               history entry which isn't there.
          NOHUP
               Don't send the HUP signal to running jobs when the
               shell exits.
          NO_LIST_BEEP
               Don't beep on an ambiguous completion.
          NO_NOMATCH (-3)
               If  a  pattern  for  filename  generation  has  no
               matches,  leave  it unchanged in the argument list
               instead of printing an error.
          NO_PROMPT_CR (-V)
               Don't print a carriage return just before printing
               a prompt in the line editor.
          NO_RCS (-f)
               Do not source the .zshenv, .zshrc, .zlogin,  .zlo-
               gout, or .zprofile files.

          NOTIFY (-5)
               Report the status of background jobs  immediately,

               prompt.
          NOUNSET (-u)
               Treat unset parameters as an error when substitut-
               ing.
          NULLGLOB (-G)
               If  a  pattern  for  filename  generation  has  no
               matches, delete the pattern from the argument list
               instead  of   reporting   an   error.    Overrides
               NO_NOMATCH.
          NUMERICGLOBSORT
               If numeric filenames are  matched  by  a  filename
               generation pattern, sort the filenames numerically

               Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.
          PATH_DIRS (-Q)
               Perform a path search even on command  names  with
               slashes  in  them.  Thus if "/usr/local/bin" is in
               the user's path, and  he  types  "X11/xinit",  the
               command  "/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit"  will  be exe-
               cuted (assuming it exists).
          PRINT_EXIT_VALUE (-C)
               Print the exit value  of  programs  with  non-zero

          PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
               Don't push multiple copies of the  same  directory
               onto the directory stack.
          PUSHD_MINUS
               See popd below.
          PUSHD_SILENT (-E)
               Do not print the directory stack  after  pushd  or
               popd.
          PUSHD_TO_HOME (-D)
               Have pushd with no arguments act like pushd $HOME.
          RC_EXPAND_PARAM (-P)
               See Parameter Expansion.
          RC_QUOTES

               gle quote within singly quoted strings.
          RECEXACT (-S)
               In completion, recognize  exact  matches  even  if
               they are ambiguous.
          RMSTARSILENT (-H)
               Do not query the user before executing "rm  *"  or

               Read commands from the standard input.
          SH_WORD_SPLIT (-y)
               See Parameter Expansion.
          SINGLE_LINE_ZLE (-M)
               Use single-line command line  editing  instead  of
               multi-line.
          SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK (-L)
               If a line ends with a backquote, and there are  an
               odd  number  of backquotes on the line, ignore the
               trailing backquote.  This is useful on  some  key-
               boards  where the return key is too small, and the
               backquote key lies annoyingly close to it.
          VERBOSE (-v)
               Print shell input lines as they are read.
          XTRACE (-x)
               Print commands and their  arguments  as  they  are
               executed.
          ZLE (-Z)
               Use the zsh line editor.
