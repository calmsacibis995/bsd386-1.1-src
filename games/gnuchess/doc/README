WHAT IS GAZEBO(c)?

Gazebo(c) is a computer chess program for Microsoft Windows(TM) 3.0,
3.1, and Windows NT. Gazebo(c) is written entirely in object-oriented 
Microsoft Visual C++ Professional(TM).

Gazebo(c) uses the null-move and history heuristics in implementing an
iterative depth-first alpha-beta search with full quiescence and
combined terminal-node and ply-1 evaluation tables. Depth-limited and
time-limited search are featured.

Gazebo(c) is a tightly-coded, efficient algorithm, which avoids
the "bloated" approach of other chess programs, yet still offers
beautiful color graphics, an attractive icon, integrated mouse
handling, and super-fast startup.

Gazebo(c) is priced at $25 and is sold by The MSM Company, 25682 
Cresta Loma, Laguna Niguel, Ca. 92677, 714-347-8107. Gazebo(c) is
