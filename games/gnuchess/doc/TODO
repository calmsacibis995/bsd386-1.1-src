Fixup the dos makefile and check it out on dos.

Remove opening lines gnuchess doesn't play well.

The hint problem.  If the hint is a promotion move easy mode
doesnt work right. It is currently bypassed in this case.
Search doesn't save the fact its a promotion move in the
PV. So hint and post only show the move without the piece
being promoted to. Cannot do easy mode off, because it must
know the piece being promoted to. Somehow should save it in PV.
Also true for hashtable entries. flags are not saved they should
be.

Something is wrong with the time calculation, sometimes the number
of moves to the next time control is set to -1.
1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. white go make this happen.

Make the timing function smarter.
Allow extra time whenever the score is changing a lot
Use the current depth as a parameter.
(the closer to zero it start the more a change should count)
If the opponent seem to have made a blunder it might be a trap.
If gnuchess is getting behind there might be a way out. (try to find it)

Add languages to the language file.

Improve performace by modifying the search extension logic.

Make the hash table include castling flags + ep flag.
Currently only the transposition file include any of these and
then only castling for the side to move.
