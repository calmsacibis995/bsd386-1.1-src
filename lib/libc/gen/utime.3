.Sh NAME
.Nm utime
.Nd set file times
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <time.h>
.Fd #include <utime.h>
.Ft int
.Fn utime "const char *file" "const struct utimbuf *timep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn utime
function sets the access and modification times of the named file from
the structure addressed by
.Fa timep .
.Pp
If
.Fa timep
is
.Dv NULL ,
the file access and modification times are set
to the current time.
The calling process's effective user ID must be the super-user or
must match the owner of the file,
or the calling process must have write permission for the file.
.Pp
If
.Fa timep
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the file's access and modification times are set
to the specified values.
The calling process's effective user ID must match the owner of the
file or must be the super-user.
The
.Fa utimbuf
structure has the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct utimbuf {
	time_t	actime;
	time_t	modtime;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The access time of the file is taken from the
.Fa actime
member and the modification time is taken from the
.Fa modtime
member.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Utime
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix;
or the
.Fa timep
argument is
.Dv NULL
and the effective user ID of the process does not
match the owner of the file, and is not the super-user, and write
access is denied.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Xr File
or
.Fa timep
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading or writing the affected inode.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa timep
argument is not
.Dv NULL
and the calling process's effective user ID
does not match the owner of the file and is not the super-user.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.
