See WHATSNEW for change listing.

installation notes:
--------
Read the comments at the beginning of Makefile before running.

Utils.h contains some things that just might have to be modified on
some systems, as well as a nested include (ugh) of <assert.h>.

Split.c is used for regression testing but is not part of the RE routines
themselves.

"make h" builds regex.h, which is needed for everything else.  You may need
to "chmod +x mkh" first.

After that, just "make" will build regcomp.o, regexec.o, regfree.o,
and regerror.o (the actual routines), bundle them together into a test
program, and run regression tests on them.  No output is good output.

"make o" builds just the .o files for the actual routines (e.g. when
you're happy with testing, have adjusted CFLAGS for production compile,
have done "make clean", and want to build just the library .o files).

Regex.h goes in /usr/include.  All other .h files are internal only.
