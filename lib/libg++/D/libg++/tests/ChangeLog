Sat Dec  4 16:14:38 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* test_h.cc:  Remove #include <sys/socket.h> and <sys/resource.h>.
	They're included by <osfcn.h>, and the multiple inclusion
	loses on some systems (e.g. Ultrix).  Also, don't #include
	<sys/param.h>, as it's non-Posix.

Wed Nov 24 12:41:07 1993  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* test_h.cc: Include limits.h rather than values.h.

Mon Oct 11 15:16:52 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* tSet.exp:  Change VOHSet output to match new code.

Wed Sep 15 14:46:40 1993  Mike Stump  (mrs@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.sh (LIB_FOR_tInteger): Add -lm for tInteger.

Thu Aug 26 18:05:20 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* tInteger.cc (iotest), tInteger.inp, tInteger.exp:
	Test a couple of more things.

Thu Aug 19 21:41:40 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in (CXXINCLUDES): Remove line - not needed.

Thu Aug 19 12:44:14 1993  Mike Stump  (mrs@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in (CXXINCLUDES): Add -I../../libio so that make check
	works when srcdir != objdir.

Sat Jul 24 17:50:52 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* tComplex.cc: Add #include <builtin.h>, for abs(double).

Tue Jun  1 17:02:12 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.sh:  Take out tFile, since it depends on GNU iostream.
	* tInteger.cc (main), tInteger.exp:  Add test for setbit/clearbit.
	* tRational.cc (pitest):  Only test >? and <? if g++.
	* tRational.cc (simpletest), tRational.exp:  New test.
	* tString.cc (splittest):  Cast 0 to (char*), to avoid ambiguity.
	* tFix.cc (checkb), tFix16.cc (check), tFix24.cc (check):
	New overloaded functions, to avoid ambiguities.
	* tFix.cc (main):  Explicitly call Integer::as_double().
	* tBag.cc, tBitSet.cc, tBitString.cc, tDeque.cc, tFix.cc, tFix16.cc,
	tFix24.cc, tInteger.cc, tMap.cc, tObstack.cc, tPQ.cc, tQueue.cc,
	tRational.cc, tSet.cc, tStack.cc, tVec.cc:  Make sure main() return 0.
	* test_h.cc:  Don't include GNU-iostream specific files unless
	we're using GNU iostream.

Fri May 21 12:57:37 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@deneb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Define TOLIBGXX.
	* tiLList.cc, tList.cc:  #include <iostream.h>, not old <stream.h>.

Tue Apr 27 13:53:46 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Removed bogus re-definition of WRAP_C_INCLUDES/
	* tString.cc, tFile.cc, tComplex, tRandom.cc (main):  Return 0.

Mon Apr 19 01:30:01 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in:  Re-vamped configure scheme.
	* Makefile.sh:  New shell scipt, used at configure time.
	This generates the repetitive rules of the Makefile.
	* tBitSet.cc, tBitString.cc:  Prefer new "standardized"
	method names prev() instead of previous().

Thu Jan 21 18:27:27 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tFix.cc:  Remove obsolete 'overload' declarations.

Mon Jan 18 16:49:19 1993  Brendan Kehoe  (brendan@lisa.cygnus.com)

	* tString.cc: Include stream.h for dec(int) support.

Sun Nov  1 14:44:13 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tInteger.cc (modtest):  New function, from a bug report.
	* tInteger.exp: New output.

Fri Oct 16 15:33:11 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Remove some obsolete junk.

Fri Sep 25 11:32:47 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tiLList.cc:  New files (derived from tList.cc) to
	check template-based versions of SLList and DLList.
	* Makefile.in:  Use tiLList.cc.

Mon Aug 10 15:11:42 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (make-tests):  New rule to build all the
	tests without running them (useful when ross-compiling.)
	* tSet.cc (main):  Rename argc <-> argv.
	* tSet.exp, tBag.exp, tMap.exp:  Update to handle new hashing
	policy for <int>VH{Set,Bag,Map} classes.

Mon Jul 20 15:45:29 1992  Mike Stump  (mrs@cygnus.com)

	* tObstack.cc (main):  Add cast from void * to char since it is
	not a standard conversion.

Fri Jun 26 11:46:53 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tRational.cc:  Use the slightly more standard M_PI
	instead of plain PI.

Wed Jun 17 16:50:45 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Fix *clean rules.  Add $(LDFLAGS) when linking.
	Remove the '-' error suppressing prefix so that failing
	checks cause the make to fail.
	Clean out the remnants of the obsolete runtests rule.
	* out.iostream, out.old-stream:  Removed - no longer used.
	* test_h.cc:  Don't #include <bstring.h> - it is non-standard.

Thu May 14 15:08:37 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* test_h.cc: Only #include sys/socket.h and sys/resource.h
	if these are available (according to _G_config.h).

Fri May  8 15:41:12 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Pass $(NOSTDINC) to compiler.

Thu May  7 00:48:11 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tList.cc (randseq):  Evaluate 1st parameter of recursive
	call to randeq() first (separately).  (Unspecified order of
	parameter evaluation was why the sun3 and sun4 versions
	gave different results.)

Wed May  6 01:10:58 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tList.cc:  For randseq(), use a dumb but portable
	"random" number generator.  (For unknown reason, the
	old code gave different result on sun3 and sun4.)
	* tList.exp:  New output.
	* Makefile.in:  Don't run 'check-tRandom' as part of
	'check', because it isn't portable (byte-order problems?).

	* iostream.out:  Split into multiple files, moving the
	tFile output into tFile.exp, etc.
	* Makefile.in:  Add lots of new rules for check-tFile,
	check-tObstack etc.  THese run an individual test,
	and compare the output to the matching *.exp file.
	This makes it easier to track down problems, and
	adds flexibility by making it easier to add or remove tests.
	* test_h.cc:  Don't include bool.h, which is deprecated
	because it is likely to conflict with other header files.

Fri Apr 17 14:48:26 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tPQ.cc: Update delete of array to modern syntax.
	* test_h.cc:  #include _G_config.h.
	Only #include <sys/resource.h> if not SYSV.

Tue Mar 10 18:16:28 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tests_h.cc:  Include sys/time.h before sys/resource.h,
	according to traditional requirement.

Fri Mar  6 15:11:36 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tests_h.cc:  Don't include malloc.h, since it is
	not a standard include file.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Fri Jan 31 17:07:30 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Add $(LSRCS) (the generated source files)
	to DEPEND_SOURCES.  (Otherwise, make fails to generate
	some of the i*.h include files.)

	* Makefile.in: Add i{CH,Splay}Node.{cc,h,o} (because
	CHNode and SplayNode have been moved into their own
	include files).
	* out.iostream: Change to match real output (now that
	all discrepancies from old output are explained).

Sat Jan 25 00:32:45 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Replace libtest.a by LIBTEST macro.
	* out.iostream:  "Fix".
	* tFile.cc: New iostream class and classes derived from
	it allow us to support much more of the fucntionality
	of the old library.

Thu Jan 16 18:00:04 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* expected.out, out_iostream, out.old_stream, Makefile.in:
	Replace expected.out by two versions:  One when using new
	iostreams, and one for old streams.
	* Makefile.in:  Some tweaks to 'make depend.'
	* tFix16.cc, tFix24.cc:  Replace check macro by overloaded
	inline functions.   This forces side effects (including
	error messages) when evaluating the operands to happen
	before printing.
	* tFile.cc:  Comditionally compile depending on
	_OLD_STREAMS macro (defined by stream.h) so that most
	tests work for both new iostreams as well as old streams.
	* test_h.cc:  Remove obsolete include files.

Sun Jan  5 00:03:06 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in:  Add 'make depend' support.
	* tBag.cc, tMap.cc, tPQ.cc, tSet.cc:  #include <builtin.h>,
	because new iostream library doesn't automatically include it.
	* tFile.cc, test_h.cc:  #ifdef out code that won't work with new
	iostream library.  Other tweaks for new library.
