-- xferstats: updated version written by Dave Datta.  (datta@cs.uwp.edu)

-- upload: default was to not allow uploads ever.  This is backwards, if
           no upload keywords are given, it should act like a normal server.

-- double conversion: double conversion stuff works now... but  you know that
           already.  Included is a gzip2comp (in util) for converting from
           gzip format to compress.

-- cwd_beenhere(): now calls realpath(".", cwd) to figure out the path.
           This works for people in directories that are private.  That
           is that some component of their path is not readable by them.
           (cwdir() fails in such a case.)

-- upload: trying to set a file mode of 0000 would fail.  This is now
           possible.

-- makedir: Did not work properly for real users.  This has also been 
           fixed.

-- fixed up support for NeXT and other systems.  I can not test these things,
           so there are bound to be problems.

-- getgrent.c: removed the need for getgrent.c from the support library.
           This caused problems with systems running yellow pages (NIS).
           All gids in the private file are now parsed before the chroot().
           This gives us one less open file descriptor.

-- upload/truncate: STORE was not properly trunctating files when 
           overwriting them.

-- upload failing with directories in makedir/put commands: STORE and
           MAKEDIR were failing when giving full path names.

-- process ids: multiple process ids were written into the pid-files when
           a failed login attempt was made.  This caused problems with
           usage counts.

-- %E magic cookie: the %E cookie gets replaced with the "email" string
           from the ftpaccess file.

-- %F magic cookie: added trivial support for Solaris 2.1 (at least).
           If you fix this for your system, send me a patch.

-- %N magic cookie: did not work after the chroot().  The pid file has
           to remain open for the duration of the server's life now in
           order for this to work.

-- support/paths.h: removed the need for this file.  It caused more
           problems than it was worth.  The two #defines that were used
           were moved to src/pathnames.h

-- upload * no dirs: you can now specify a directory that does not allow
           uploads but does allow the creation of directories.

-- alias list: you can now get a listing of what aliases are available.
           at the ftp prompt type "quote site alias".

-- cdpath: you can now specify a cdpath (like the csh variable).

-- email: you can specify an email address for the maintainer of the
           archive.  This string will be used for the %E magic cookie.
