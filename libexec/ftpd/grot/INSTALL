INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

0.  READ THE NOTES FILE!

1.  edit src/pathnames.h to conform to your needs.  

    _PATH_FTPUSERS  "/etc/ftpusers"
        The file that lists users that can never ftp in.  Usually contains
        root and all usernames not connected to a real person (eg. bin, sync,
        nobody, etc.)
    _PATH_FTPACCESS "/usr/local/etc/ftpaccess"
        The configuration file for the server.
    _PATH_FTPHOSTS  "/etc/ftphosts"
        The individual user access configuration file.
**  _PATH_EXECPATH  "/bin/ftp-exec"
        The directory that contains additional binaries for use with the
        SITE EXEC command.
    _PATH_PIDNAMES  "/usr/local/daemon/ftpd/ftp.pids-%s"
        The filename template for pid files.  The %s gets automagically 
        replaced by the proper classname.  There will be as many pid files
        as there are classes in your ftpaccess.
    _PATH_CVT       "/usr/local/etc/ftpconversions"
        The file that contains the conversion (file -> file.Z, etc) 
        configuration.  See ftpconversions.5 for a description of the format.
    _PATH_XFERLOG   "/usr/adm/xferlog"
        The file where all logging information is placed.
    _PATH_PRIVATE   "/etc/ftpgroups"
        The group password file for use with the SITE GROUP and SITE GPASS
        commands.  See ftpaccess.5 for a description of the format.
    _PATH_UTMP      "/etc/utmp"
        Where your utmp file lives.
    _PATH_WTMP      "/usr/adm/wtmp"
        Where your wtmp file lives.
    _PATH_LASTLOG   "/usr/adm/lastlog"
        Where your lastlog file lives.
    _PATH_BSHELL    "/bin/sh"
        Where bourne shell lives
    _PATH_DEVNULL   "/dev/null"
        What /dev/null is.  I can't imagine that this could ever be different.

**  This path is relative to ~ftp.  To add the same functionality for real
    users, create a symbolic link from ~ftp/_PATH_EXEC to /_PATH_EXEC.

2a. build xxx

    where xxx is one of:
        gen : generic make (copy this when porting to a new system)
        aix : IBM AIX
        bsd : BSDI bsd/386
        dgx : Data General Unix
        dyn : Dynix
        hpx : HP-UX
		isc : ISC
        lnx : Linux (tested on 0.99p8)
        nx2 : NeXTstep 2.x
        nx3 : NeXTstep 3.x
        osf : OSF/1
        ptx : ???
        sgi : SGI Irix 4.0.5a
        sny : Sony NewsOS
        sol : SunOS 5.x / Solaris 2.x
        s41 : SunOS 4.1.x (requires acc or gcc 2.3.3 or better)
                          (if you must use gcc 1.4.2, mail me for a patch)
        ult : Ultrix 4.x

    If cc complains about strunames, typenames, modenames, ... being undefined
    you need to install support/ftp.h as /usr/include/arpa/ftp.h (always make
    a backup of the old ftp.h just in case!) and do the build again.  The new
    ftp.h should be a compatible superset of your existing ftp.h, so you
    shouldn't have problems with this replacement.

    If you are using gcc...  Make sure that you the include files have been
    properly "fixed" according to the gcc 2.3.3 INSTALL instructions.  If
    the server crashes before printing the banner message (during a vprintf)
    this is most probably the cause.

    Some machines may not have a definition of pid_t; so if your compiler
    complains about this you should add to src/config.h

            typedef int pid_t;

2b. If your system is not defined above...
        cp src/config/config.gen src/config/config.xxx
        cp src/makefiles/Makefile.gen src/makefiles/Makefile.xxx
        cp support/makefiles/Makefile.gen support/makefiles/Makefile.xxx

    Edit the three files appropriately.  Go back to step 2a.

3.  build install

4.  edit /etc/inetd.conf to point to the new ftpd

5.  on BSD-ish systems: kill -1 `ps t"?" | grep inetd`
    on SGI systems: /etc/killall -HUP inetd

6.  for the server to support creation of .tar.Z files of directories, you
    need GNU tar installed [remember to put a copy in the anonymous ftp
    hierarchy].  If you need a copy, it is available from
    wuarchive.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4] in /gnu.

7.  copy /wherever/compress to ~ftp/bin/compress.

8.  copy the ftpconversions, ftpusers, and ftpgroups files to the 
    locations specifed in pathnames.h.  There are examples of these
    files in the doc/examples directory.

9.  create the directory for the SITE EXEC programs, as specified in 
    pathnames.h.  Put any executables that you want anonymous users to 
    be able to run in this directory.  Be careful what you put here.

10. run bin/ckconfig to make sure that all the support files are
    properly installed.
