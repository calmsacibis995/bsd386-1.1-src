.Sh NAME
.Nm exports
.Nd define remote mount points for
.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm exports
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm exports
file
specifies remote mount points for the
.Tn NFS
mount protocol per the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification \\*(tNRFC\\*(sP 1094" .
.Pp
Blank lines and lines beginning with
.Li #
are treated as comments and are ignored.
Each non-comment line in the file specifies one remote mount point.
The first field is the mount point directory path followed
optionally by export options and specific hosts separated by white space.
Only the first entry for a given local file system may specify the export
options, since these are handled on a
.Em per local file system
basis.
If no specific hosts are specified,
the mount point is exported to all hosts.
.Pp
Each listed mount point must be an absolute pathname; symbolic links
are not allowed for any component of the name.
However, clients may mount directories using a name containing symbolic links.
When a client mount request is processed, any symbolic names in
the requested path are translated before checking the name against
the export list.
For example, if
.Pa /sys
is a symbolic link to
.Pa /usr/src/sys ,
and if
.Pa /usr/src/sys
is exported, a client can mount
.Pa /usr/src/sys
using either name.
.Pp
The export options are as follows:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Fl root No = Aq Sy uid
.Sm on
specifies how to map root's uid (default 65534).
The option
.Fl r
is synonyms for
.Fl root
in an effort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.
.Pp
.Fl ro
specifies that the file system should be exported Read-only
(default Read/Write).
The option
.Fl o
is synonyms for
.Fl ro
in an effort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.
.Pp
.Fl alldirs
specifies that all directories in the listed file system should be exported.
The path name must be the root of a locally mounted file system.
.Pp
.Fl subdirs
specifies that the listed directory and all directories below the listed
directory within the same local file system should be exported.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr -root=0 rickers snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
/usr/local -subdirs 131.104.48.16
/u -root=5
/u2 -ro -alldirs
.Ed
.Pp
Given that
.Sy /usr ,
.Sy /u
and
.Sy /u2
are
local file system mount points, the above example specifies the following:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Sy /usr
is exported to hosts
.Em rickers
and
.Em snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
with
root mapped to root.
.Pp
.Sy /usr/local
and all of its subdirectories
are exported to host
.Em 131.104.48.16
with root mapped to root.
.Pp
.Sy /u
is exported to all hosts with root mapped to uid 5.
.Pp
All directories in
.Sy /u2
are exported to all hosts Read-only with root mapped to 65534.
.Ed
.Pp
Note that
.Dq Li "/usr/local -root=5"
would have been incorrect,
as
.Sy /usr
and
.Sy /usr/local
reside in the same local file system.
.Sh FILES

It would be nice if the export options were not tied to local mount points.
