.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm slattach
is used to assign a tty line to a network interface,
and to define the network source and destination addresses.
The following operands are supported by
.Nm slattach :
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar ttyname
Specifies the name of the tty device.
.Ar ttyname
should be a string of the form
.Ql ttyXX ,
or
.Ql /dev/ttyXX .
.It Ar baudrate
Specifies the speed of the connection.  If not specified, the
default of 9600 is used.
.El
.Pp
Only the super-user may attach a network interface.
.Pp
To detach the interface, use
.Dq Li ifconfig interface-name down
after killing off the
.Nm slattach
process.
.Ar interface-name
is the name that is shown by
.Xr netstat 1 .
.Pp
.Nm Slattach
places the specified tty in raw mode using
.Xr cfmakeraw 3 .
.Pp
.Nm Slattach
is intended to be used to run SLIP over dedicated lines (typically used in
.Pa /etc/netstart ) .
For dial-up services use
.Xr startslip 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
# Dedicated 57600-baud SLIP on /dev/tty01
ifconfig sl0 myhost rmthost link2 up
stty -f /dev/tty01 cts_oflow rts_iflow
slattach /dev/tty01 57600
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exit, the
requested address is unknown, the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.
