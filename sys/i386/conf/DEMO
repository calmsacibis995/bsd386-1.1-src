#	SS-16/2 goes on a 16k boundary.
#
#	In the version 1.3 of the driver the low flag bit turns on
#	input speedups when the tty is in raw mode.  This has been
#	tested with UUCP and SLIP but if it gives you problems it
#	can be disabled by clearing the bit -- either here or via
#	msconfig(8).
#
#	The rest of the flags enable compatibility with pre-D7 (SS-8/2)
#	or D-X2 (SS-4PLUS) ROMs.  See ms(4) for details.
