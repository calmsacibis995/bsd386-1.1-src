The boot floppies are built using an inherently manual process.  This file
is meant to give you a basic description.

The floppy must be formatted e.g.:
	# fdformat fd0 floppy

Then labelled:
	# disklabel -r -w fd0 floppy Boot1 \
		/usr/bootstraps/fdboot /usr/bootstraps/bootfd

Then newfs'ed:
	# newfs -b 4096 -f 512 -c 80 -i 3072 /dev/rfd0a

	(these options set the block/frag size to 4k/512, make a 
	 single cylinder group with all the tracks, and reduce the 
	 number of inodes (slightly) from 1/4k of data to 1/3k of data space)

You can then mount the floppy and start copying stuff to it.

The binaries used on the boot floppies are built in subdirectories 
of this directory.  The makefiles here assume /usr/src is the full source
tree, so you'll have to either have it, or point /usr/src to /usr/src on 
the CDROM.  `make install' in this directory copies the binaries to 
the `bin' subdirectory and strips them.  The following lists of files
(suitable for source-ing by a bourne style shell) give lists of what
files can be compressed and which must be left uncompressed.

# CFILES are files which we copy from the bin directory and compress
CFILES="dd diskdefect disklabel disksetup fsck ftp
	ifconfig installsw ls mkdir mknod mount mt pax ping pwd
	restore route rsh scsicmd slattach sync test umount vi"

# EFILES are files we copy from the bin directory and don't compress
EFILES="chmod gzip init ln mount_iso9660 newfs rm sh stty tail"

# BOGUS files are binaries we create but don't use
BOGUS="cat compress cp mv tar"

# SCRIPTS are files we copy from the scripts directory
SCRIPTS="uncompress setup.boot1 setup.boot2 cat cp mv"

# BFILES are files that belong in /bin
BFILES="cat chmod cp dd ftp gzip ln ls mkdir mt mv pax pwd rm
	rsh sh stty sync tail test vi uncompress"

# SFILES are files that belong in /sbin
SFILES="diskdefect disklabel disksetup fsck ifconfig init installsw
	mknod mount mount_iso9660 newfs ping restore route
	scsicmd setup slattach umount"
SLINKS="newfs mount_mfs"

The MAKEDEV script in /dev on the distribution includes a target
called `floppydev' which creates a suitable /dev for the floppy.

The minimal bootable floppy must contain:

	/dev
	/bsd
	/boot
	/bin/sh
	/sbin/init

You probably also want to include a /.profile and stty as well.  Other 
programs are optional depending on what you want the floppy for.

The /boot on the floppy is usually /stand/flboot rather than /boot.  The
only difference is that flboot will prompt with the `change floppies' 
prompt before executing the loaded kernel if it's booting from a floppy
device.
