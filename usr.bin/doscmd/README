# The major change to DOSCMD was the addition of the setver command to
# the .doscmdrc file.  This allows setting the reported version of DOS
# on a per command basis, much like the setver.exe command in DOS.
# A few other minor nits were fixed as well.

This is an alpha distribution of the new merged doscmd/rundos project.

Please read the man page for help on configuring doscmd.

Things known not to work:

    *	No mouse support (yet)
    *	No xms/ems support (yet)
    *	No raw VGA support (yet)
    *	Printer support (yet)
    *	COM ports (being worked on)
    *	redirected file system only supported for DOS 4.0 and above
	(3.3 will be supported in a future version)
    *	Graphics in an X window (not planned to work)

Even with this, I think it is actually a much better product.  There have 
been problems reported with the ibmpc font and the distributed X server.
If you have that problem, try setting

	X11_FONT=fixed

in your .doscmdrc.  Be aware that graphics characters will not print correctly
if you do this.

You will need to patch your kernel.  Diffs are provided against the CD-ROM.
Please let me know if there are a problem with them (I am running a pre 1.1
kernel now).

It is possible there are some problems in the floppy code due to the fact
that I am not set up to test under 1.0 at this point.  I will be in a few
days I hope.

Please send all bug reports to prb@BSDI.COM.
