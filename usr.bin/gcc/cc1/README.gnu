This directory contains the version 1.42 release of the GNU C compiler.
All serious bugs (that would make ordinary C programs fail) reported for
previous test releases have been fixed.  We have often decided not to fix
bugs that are Less important, to avoid risking creating new bugs.

See the file gcc.texinfo for installation and porting information.
The file INSTALL contains a copy of the installation information.

The GNU C compiler is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.

The files print-self.c and print-self1.c are not part of GCC.
They are programs that print themselves on standard output.
They were written by Dario Dariol and Giovanni Cozzi, and are
included for your hacking pleasure.
