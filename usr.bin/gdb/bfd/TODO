Things that still need to be done: -*- Text -*-

 o - implement bfd_abort, which should close the bfd but not alter the
     filesystem.

 o - update the bfd doc; write a how-to-write-a-backend doc, take out
     the stupid quips and fill in all the blanks.

 o - upgrade the reloc handling as per Steve's suggestion.
