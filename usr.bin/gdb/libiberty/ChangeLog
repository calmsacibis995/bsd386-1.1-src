Thu Mar 19 13:57:42 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* argv.c:  Fix various external function definitions to be
	correct in an ANSI compilation environment.

Sat Mar 14 17:28:17 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* obstack.c:  Changes to support calling mmalloc functions,
	which take an additional argument over malloc functions.

Thu Feb 27 22:19:39 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced

	strrchr().

Thu Dec 19 18:35:03 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Remove "***" in normal output, since Make produces
	this on errors, and it's convenient to search for.

Tue Dec 17 23:21:30 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* memcmp.c, memcpy.c, memmove.c, memset.c, strchr.c, strrchr.c:
	New ANSI functions.  The old non-ANSI functions (such as bcopy)
	should be avoided.
	* bcopy.c:  Fix to correctly handle overlapping regions.

	* functions.def:  Add the new functions.
	* functions.def:  Add 4th parameter to DEF macro,
	an ansidecl.h-style prototype.
	* dummy.c:  Use expanded DEF macro to create a dummy function
	call, with correct parameter types.  (This avoids some
	complaints from gcc about predefined builtins.)

	Move the functionality of config/mh-default into Makefile.in.
	This avoid duplication, and simplifies things slightly.
	* Makefile.in:  Tweak so we don't need config/mh-default.
	* README:  Update.
	* configure.in:  No longer need config/mh-default.
	* config/mh-default:  Deleted.

	'mknod' device numbers.

Mon Dec 16 12:25:34 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* fdmatch.c, Makefile.in:  Add new function that takes two
	open file descriptors and returns nonzero if they refer to
	the same file, zero otherwise.  (used in gdb)

Wed Dec 11 17:40:39 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)
	From DJ:
	* msdos.c: stub functions for dos.
	* makefile.dos, configdj.bat: new.

Tue Dec 10 04:14:49 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: infodir belongs in datadir.

Fri Dec  6 23:26:45 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: remove spaces following hyphens because bsd make
	  can't cope.  added standards.text support.  install using
	  INSTALL_DATA.

	* configure.in: remove commontargets as it is no longer a
	  recognized hook.

Thu Dec  5 22:46:46 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: idestdir and ddestdir go away.  Added copyrights
	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.

Fri Nov 22 19:15:29 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  find-needed.awk does not fit in 14 chars.

	* Makefile.in:  Suppress error checking when compiling the test
	program, because Ultrix make/sh aborts there due to a bug.

Fri Nov 22 12:23:17 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Re-did how EXTRA_OFILES is used to be more useful.
	* README:  Explained how the auto-configuration works,
	and how to add new files and/or configurations.

Fri Nov 22 09:45:23 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* strtoul.c:  Avoid defining ULONG_MAX if already defined;
	cast a const char * to char * for pedants.

	* getopt.c:  Only define "const" after local include files get to,
	and only if they haven't defined it.

Thu Nov 21 16:58:53 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* getcwd.c (remove getwd.c): GNU code should call getcwd().  We
	emulate it with getwd() if available.  This avoids callers having
	to find a MAXPATHLEN or PATH_MAX value from somewhere.
	* Makefile.in, functions.def:  getwd->getcwd.
	* configure.in:  Use generic case for every system.
	* config/mh-{delta88,mach,rs6000,svr4}:  Remove.
	* config/mh-sysv:  Use default handling, just add -DUSG.

Thu Nov 14 10:58:05 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, config/mh-default: Re-do make magic
	so that for the default ("automatic") mode we only
	compile the files we actually need.  Do this using
	a recursive make:  The top-level generates the list
	of needed files (loosely, the ones missing in libc),
	and then passes that list to the recursive make.
	* config/mh-mach:  Remove obsolete STRERROR-{C,O} macros.

Tue Nov 12 19:10:57 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	RS/6000 host support (grumble).

	* configure.in:  Build alloca-conf.h file from alloca-norm.h
	(everything else) or alloca-botch.h (rs/6000).
	* Makefile.in:  Include . on the include path.
	* getopt.c:  Use alloca-conf.h.
	* alloca-norm.h:  How to declare alloca on reasonable machines.
	* alloca-botch.h: How to declare alloca on braindead machines.

Tue Nov 12 09:21:48 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* concat.c :  New file, like concat() in gdb but can take a
	variable number of arguments rather than fixed at 3 args.  For
	now, client applications must supply an xmalloc(), which is a
	front end function to malloc() that deals with out-of-memory
	conditions.

	* Makefile.in:  Add concat.c and concat.o to appropriate macros.

Sat Nov  9 13:29:59 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* config/mh-svr4:  Add sigsetmask to list of required functions.

Sun Nov  3 11:57:56 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* vsprintf.c:  New file.
	* functions.def, Makefile.in:  Add vsprintf.

Sun Oct 27 16:31:22 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, config/mh-rs6000:  Add rs/6000 host support.
	* Makefile.in:  Compile with debug info.

Fri Oct 25 17:01:12 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, and new files: dummy.c, functions.def,
	config/mf-default:  Added a default configuration mode,
	which includes into libiberty.a functions that are "missing" in libc.
	* strdup.c, vprintf.c, vfprintf.c: New files.

Thu Oct 24 02:29:26 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* config/hmake-svr4: New file.

	* config/hmake-sysv: Add HOST_CFILES and HOST_OFILES.

	* basename.c, bcmp.c, bcopy.c, bzero.c, getpagesize.c getwd.c,
	index.c, insque.c, rindex.c, spaces.c, strstr.c, vfork.c: New
	files containing either portable C versions or emulations using
	native library calls.

	* strerror.c:  Add copyright, internal documentation, etc.

	* strtol.c:  Replace hardwired hex constants with some more
	portable macros.  Remove illegal (according to gcc) cast.

	* strtoul.c: Replace hardwired hex constant with more portable
	macro.

	* Makefile.in: Move TARGETLIB and CFLAGS where makefile fragments
	can override them.  Add new source and object file names to CFILES
	and OFILES respectively.

	* configure.in: Add support for SVR4 makefile fragments.

Tue Oct 22 19:00:23 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Move RANLIB, AR and AR_FLAGS to where they can be
	over-ridden by config/hmake-*
	* configure.in: added m88kcvs to sysv list

Fri Oct  4 01:29:08 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Most hosts need strerror, but one or two don't,
	and they override these definitions in the host-dependent makefile
	fragment.
	* config/hmake-mach:  The odd man out on strerror -- it's supplied.
	* strerror.c:  New file.

	* strtol.c, strtoul.c:  Add strtol to libiberty, since Mach lacks
	it and bfd uses it.
	* configure.in, Makefile.in, config/hmake-mach:  Only configure
	strtol & strotoul in on Mach.

Tue Sep  3 06:36:23 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* obstack.c:  Merge with latest FSF version.
