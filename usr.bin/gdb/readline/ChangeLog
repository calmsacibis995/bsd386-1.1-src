	* history.c (history_do_write) Build a buffer of all of the lines
	to write and write them in one fell swoop (lower overhead than
	calling write () for each line).  Suggested by Peter Ho.

	* vi_mode.c (rl_vi_subst) Don't forget to end the undo group.

Sat Mar  7 00:15:36 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

Thu Feb 20 23:23:16 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* readline.c (rl_read_init_file):  Make sure that null filename is
	not passed to open() or else we end up opening the directory, and
	read a bunch of garbage into keymap[].

Mon Feb 17 17:15:09 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* readline.c (readline_default_bindings):  Only make use of VLNEXT
	when both VLNEXT and TERMIOS_TTY_DRIVER is defined.  On SVR4
	<termio.h> includes <termios.h>, so VLNEXT is always defined.

	* sysdep-norm.h (_POSIX_VERSION):  Define this for all SVR4
	systems so that <termios.h> gets used, instead of <termio.h>.

	  know how to make info anymore.

	* configure.in: commontargets is no longer a recognized hook, so
	  remove it.  new subdir called doc.

Thu Dec  5 22:46:10 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: idestdir and ddestdir go away.  Added copyrights
	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.

Fri Nov 22 09:02:32 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	portability.  Also, update copyright notice.
	readline.h:  remove config stuff that I added erroneously in the
	first place.

	* history.c:  #include "sysdep.h".

Tue Nov 19 10:49:17 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, config/hm-sysv, config/hm-sco:  Change SYSV to
	USG to match current usage.

	* readline.c:  Add USGr4 to list of defined things to check for
	to use <dirent.h> style directory access.

	* readline.c; Make a distinction between having a TERMIOS tty
	driver, and having POSIX signal handling.  You might one without
	the other.  New defines used HAVE_POSIX_SIGNALS, and
	TERMIOS_TTY_DRIVER.

Tue Jul 30 22:37:26 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	error, but with zero characters, the file is empty, so return EOF.

Thu Jul 11 20:58:38 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: (rl_get_next_history, rl_get_previous_history)
	Reallocate the buffer space if the line being moved to is longer
	the the current space allocated.  Amazing that no one has found

	* readline.c: Rework parsing conditionals to pay attention to the
	prior states of the conditional stack.  This makes $if statements
	work correctly.

Mon Jun 24 20:45:59 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: support for displaying key binding information
	includes the functions rl_list_funmap_names (),
	invoking_keyseqs_in_map (), rl_invoking_keyseqs (),
	rl_dump_functions (), and rl_function_dumper ().

	funmap.c: support for same includes rl_funmap_names ().

	readline.c, funmap.c: no longer define STATIC_MALLOC.  However,
	update both version of xrealloc () to handle a null pointer.

Thu Apr 25 12:03:49 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* vi_mode.c (rl_vi_fword, fWord, etc.  All functions use
	the macro `isident()'.  Fixed movement bug which prevents
	continious movement through the text.

Fri Jul 27 16:47:01 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c (parser_if) Allow "$if term=foo" construct.

Wed May 23 16:10:33 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c (rl_dispatch) Correctly remember the last command
	executed.  Fixed typo in username_completion_function ().

Mon Apr  9 19:55:48 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: username_completion_function (); For text passed in
	with a leading `~', remember that this could be a filename (after
	it is completed).

Thu Apr  5 13:44:24 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: rl_search_history (): Correctly handle case of an
	unfound search string, but a graceful exit (as with ESC).

	* readline.c: rl_restart_output ();  The Apollo passes the address
	of the file descriptor to TIOCSTART, not the descriptor itself.

Tue Mar 20 05:38:55 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: rl_complete (); second call in a row causes possible
	completions to be listed.

	* readline.c: rl_redisplay (), added prompt_this_line variable
	which is the first character character following \n in prompt.

Sun Mar 11 04:32:03 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* Signals are now supposedly handled inside of SYSV compilation.

Wed Jan 17 19:24:09 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at sbphy.ucsb.edu)

	* history.c: history_expand (); fixed overwriting memory error,
	added needed argument to call to get_history_event ().

Thu Jan 11 10:54:04 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at sbphy.ucsb.edu)

	* readline.c: added mark_modified_lines to control the
	display of an asterisk on modified history lines.  Also
	added a user variable called mark-modified-lines to the
	`set' command.

Thu Jan  4 10:38:05 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at sbphy.ucsb.edu)

	* readline.c: start_insert ().  Only use IC if we don't have an im
	capability.

Fri Sep  8 09:00:45 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: rl_prep_terminal ().  Only turn on 8th bit
	  as meta-bit iff the terminal is not using parity.

Sun Sep  3 08:57:40 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: start_insert ().  Uses multiple
	  insertion call in cases where that makes sense.

	  rl_insert ().  Read type-ahead buffer for additional
	  keys that are bound to rl_insert, and insert them
	  all at once.  Make insertion of single keys given
	  with an argument much more efficient.

Tue Aug  8 18:13:57 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: Changed handling of EOF.  readline () returns
	 (char *)EOF or consed string.  The EOF character is read from the
	 tty, or if the tty doesn't have one, defaults to C-d.

	* readline.c: Added support for event driven programs.
	  rl_event_hook is the address of a function you want called
	  while Readline is waiting for input.

	* readline.c: Cleanup time.  Functions without type declarations
	  do not use return with a value.

	* history.c: history_expand () has new variable which is the
	  characters to ignore immediately following history_expansion_char.

Sun Jul 16 08:14:00 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* rl_prep_terminal ()
	  BSD version turns off C-s, C-q, C-y, C-v.

	* readline.c -- rl_prep_terminal ()
	  SYSV version hacks readline_echoing_p.
	  BSD version turns on passing of the 8th bit for the duration
	  of reading the line.

Tue Jul 11 06:25:01 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: new variable rl_tilde_expander.
	  If non-null, this contains the address of a function to call if
	  the standard meaning for expanding a tilde fails.  The function is
	  called with the text sans tilde (as in "foo"), and returns a
	  malloc()'ed string which is the expansion, or a NULL pointer if
	  there is no expansion. 

	* readline.h - new file chardefs.h
	  Separates things that only readline.c needs from the standard
	  header file publishing interesting things about readline.

	* readline.c:
	  readline_default_bindings () now looks at terminal chararacters
	  and binds those as well.

Wed Jun 28 20:20:51 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* Made readline and history into independent libraries.
