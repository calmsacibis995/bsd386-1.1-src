Miscellaneous flex stuff.  The following have been tested using flex 2.4:

	- debflex.awk, an awk script for anotating flex debug output.
	  It presently only works with gawk, not with "old" or "new" awk
	  (I haven't tried "mawk").

	- testxxLexer.l, a sample C++ program that uses flex's scanner
	  class option ("-+").

	- fastwc/, a subdirectory containing examples of how to use flex
	  to write progressively higher-performance versions of the Unix
	  "wc" utility.

The following are all out-of-date with respect to flex release 2.4 (and
in general up-to-date for flex 2.3):

	- flex.texinfo, a "texinfo" version of the flexdoc documentation
	  for flex release 2.3.

	- Atari/Atari.patches, patches for porting flex to the Atari and
	  to Minix.

	- A number of notes and Makefiles for compiling flex under MS-DOS,
	  in the MSDOS/ subdirectory.

	- Notes on building flex for MVS, in the MVS/ subdirectory.

	- Notes on building flex for the Macintosh using Think-C,
	  in the Think-C/ subdirectory.

	- Notes on building flex for VMS, in the VMS/ subdirectory.

And the following is included for compatibility with some broken versions
of bison:

	- alloca.c, a public-domain, mostly-portable version of the
	  alloca() routine (used by bison's parsers) written by D. A. Gwyn.


Many thanks to those who contributed these files.  Updated versions will
be appreciated!
