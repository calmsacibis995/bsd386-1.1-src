Cutoff for BSD/386 1.1 - Sat Jan 29 12:47:48 PST 1994

25. uucpd will no longer SIGKILL inetd.

24. cleaned up the setproctitle changes so that the code still works on 1.0.

23. made all the tty close()'s into close_dev()'s; close_dev() is a new
    function that tcflush()'s before close()'ing to avoid hanging in exit().

22. put in my own local mods that i've been making to 1.0 as i've gone along.

21. put bob desinger's "agelog" in as /usr/libexec/uuage, and brought over
    my daily and weekly scripts for /etc/uucp.  still need some reporting.

20. put in a possible fix for the uucico-doesn't-backoff problem.

19. uucpd was hardcoding /usr/adm/??? paths for wtmp and lastlog.

18. put in sanders' changes for setproctitle().

17. added a BUGS paragraph to uucp(1) warning against multiple file copies.
    there's a bug here but i can't see it offhand right now.

16. users who want to run 'f' protocol on non-X25 lines can do that now.

15. all /usr/lib/uucp and /usr/spool/uucp* pathnames have been changed to
    /etc/uucp, /usr/libexec, or /var/spool/uucp*.

14. An old "uusnap" perl script I wrote has been incorporated.

13. if an L.sys "DIR" entry's "phone" field (really a tty name) could not be
    found in L-devices, the last device in L-devices would be used erroneously.

12. all termios attributes settable by the chat scripts are now preserved in
    slaves.  this means that what you can change on the master, you can also
    change in the slave's getty.  this is useful for HWFLOW.

11. P_CLOCAL_{ON,OFF} now allowed in chat scripts.  reimplemented
    P_{MDMBUF,RTSCTS,HWFLOW}_{ON,OFF} and P_{ODD,EVEN,ONE,ZERO} using tables.

10. uucico wasn't running the L-devices "initial chat script" for DIR devices.

9. uucico/clocal.c file deleted (it was dead, jim.)

8. uucpd was calling lseek() with two arguments.  bad, evil.

7. the default PATH in the template L.cmds listed /usr/sbin.  evil, bad.

6. a bad bug in admin/Makefile was blowing away the user's L.sys (if any)
   and other administrative files during "make install".  these example files
   should only be installed in /etc/uucp if there aren't already copies there.

5. a default "uuxqt_hook" will now be installed in /etc/uucp.  this was
   added and documented for BSD/386 1.0, but without an example file it's
   likely that a lot of users never knew about it.  the one i added is all
   commented out but shows what (and explains why) to do to use "sendmail -q".

4. in a few places, the code has been reformatted to a semblance of KNF.
   much more needs to be done.  code is only reformatted if the entire
   enclosing function is also reformatted.

3. the old "use termio if SYSV>=3" mechanism is gone.  in its place
   we have "use termios if USE_TERMIOS defined".  this means that pure
   SYSV.3 systems will not be able to compile this unless they also have
   the POSIX "termios" in it.  (my heart is breaking even as i type this.)
   it also means that BSD>=199103 systems, which have POSIX "termios", can
   avoid all the old sgtty nonsense and use higher baud rates and so on.
   the result is that we can run 115200 baud (or 57600, the other thing
   customers have been wanting.)  the top speed of my UARTS seems to be 
   lower than 115KB since my throughput, even with illicit use of 't' proto,
   is limited to ~91K.

2. uucico gets a hard link in /usr/sbin now, in addition to its
   time-honored location in /usr/libexec.

1. uuparams is in /usr/sbin now (used to be /usr/libexec).

0. starting from BSD/386 FCS 1.0 plus interrim patches.
