	This is yet another uucp rewrite.

Each program is in its own directory, except for some administration commands
which are in "admin".  Common library routines are in "lib", non-uucp-specific
routines are in "libc", the argument processing routines are in "args",
include files are in "i", and manuals are in "man".

All site-specific details are in "i/site.h", most of them are run-time
re-configurable in the file "/etc/uucp/CONFIG" (which pathname must
be hard-wired in "site.h" - but see all programs' "-P" parameter).
Please look at "i/site.h" and "Makefile.inc" before compiling.

The Makefile targets are:
	"all"		make all libraries, programs, catman pages
	"install"	install programs and manuals
	"clean"		remove ".o" files, binaries, catman pages
