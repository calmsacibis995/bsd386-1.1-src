# agelog -- age log files, by Dave Lennert as told to Bob Desinger and
#           James Brister
#
# Usage: $0 [-m] [-p Bpid] [-s Bsig] logFile \
#           [-p Apid] [-s Asig] howMany [stashDir]
#
#
# The most recent <howMany> logs are kept around by renaming logFile to
# logFile.0, after similarly rolling logFile.0 => logFile.1 => logFile.2 => ...
# If <stashDir> is named, the old logs will be kept in that directory.  If not
# given, the old logs are left in the same directory as the original logFile.
#
# Example:
# `agelog /usr/adm/sulog 2' will, if run weekly, keep 3 files around:
#	/usr/adm/sulog    containing this week's log info
#	/usr/adm/sulog.0  containing last week's log info
#	/usr/adm/sulog.1  containing the week before last's log info
#
# A typical crontab entry:
# #	Keep the most recent 2 weeks worth of uucp logs around in
# #	/tmp/Oldlogs/*, one per day, so that old LOGFILEs will be in
# #	/tmp/Oldlogs/LOGFILE.{0,1,2,...}
# 00 1 * * * /usr/local/agelog /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE 14 /tmp/Oldlogs

#
# This now accepts some options:
#	-m 	if given before the log file name then mv will be used instead
# 	   	of cp to move the file.
#	-p pid	if given before the log file name then a signal will be
#		sent to the specified pid before the moves are done.
#		if given after the log file name then the signal is sent
#		after the moves. The default signal is HUP
#	-s sig	if given before the log file name then the signal sent
#		before the move is changed from HUP to sig. If specified
#		after the log file name then the signal sent after the move
#		is changed from HUP to sig.
#	-h	just displays the usage and exits.
#
# examples:
#	agelog -p 9999 somelog 3
#		this will send a HUP signal to pid 9999 then save 3
#		versions of the log files (using cp for the final move).
#
#	agelog -m -p 8888 somelog -p 8888 4
#		this will send a HUP signal to pid 8888 before saving the
#		4 versions of the log files and then after. It will use mv
#		for the final move (not cp).
#
#	agelog -p 7777 -s ALRM somelog -p 7777 2
#		this will send a ALRM signal to pid 7777, then it will save
#		the log files, then it will send a HUP to pid 7777
#
#	NOTE:   the changing of the BEFORE signal doesn't affect the AFTER
#	        signal. Likewise with the pid's
#
