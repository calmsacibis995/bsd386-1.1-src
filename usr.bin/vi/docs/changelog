1.01 -> 1.03:
	+ Tag stack fixes, was returning to the tag, not the position from
	  which the user tagged.
	+ Only use from the cursor to the end of the word in cursor word
	  searches and tags.  (Matches historical vi behavior.)
	+ Fix delete-last-line bug when line number option set.
	+ Fix usage line for :split command.
	+ If O_NUMBER set, long input lines would eventually fail, the column
	  count for the second screen of long lines wasn't set correctly.
	+ Fix for [[ reaching SOF with a column longer than the first line.
	+ Fix for multiple error messages if no screen displayed.
	+ Fix :read to set alternate file name as in historical practice.
	+ Fix cut to rotate the numeric buffers if line mode flag set.
1.00 -> 1.01
	+ Don't put cut items into numeric buffers if cutting less than
	  parts of two lines.
0.94 -> 1.00
	+ Read-ahead not there; BSD tty driver problem, SunOS curses
	  problem.
	+ Global command could error if it deleted the last line of
	  the file.
	+ Change '.' to only apply to the 'u' if entered immediately
	  after the 'u' command.  "1pu.u.u.  is still broken.
	+ If backward motion on a command, now move to the point; get
	  yank cursor positioning correct.
	+ Rework cut buffers to match historic practice -- yank/delete
	  numeric buffers redone sensibly, ignoring historic practice.
