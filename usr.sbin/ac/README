This program is an attempt to duplicate the standard UNIX (TM) program
"ac", which does login accounting.  We have not produced documentation
for this program because it should work in precisely the same manner as
the standard program.  If documentation is required, we will attempt to
prepare it.

Please read the file "copyright.h".
