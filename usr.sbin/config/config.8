.Dt CONFIG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm config
.Nd build system configuration files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm config
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl g
.Ar SYSTEM_NAME
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm Config
builds a set of system configuration files from the file
.Ar SYSTEM_NAME
which describes
the system to configure.
A second file
tells
.Nm config
what files are needed to generate a system and
can be augmented by a configuration specific set of files
that give alternate files for a specific machine.
(See the
.Sx FILES
section below.)
.Pp
Available options and operand:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width SYSTEM_NAME
.It Fl p
If the
.Fl p
option is supplied, 
.Nm config
will configure a system for profiling; see
.Xr kgmon 8
and
.Xr gprof 1 .
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is supplied, two versions of the kernel will be compiled,
one of them with a complete symbol table for symbolic debugging
.Pq see Xr gdb 1
and the other with a normal symbol table (which is normally used for booting).
.It Ar SYSTEM_NAME
This operand
specifies the name of the system configuration file
containing device specifications, configuration options
and other system parameters for one system configuration.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Config
should be run from the
.Pa conf
subdirectory of the system source for a specific hardware type (such as
.Pa /sys/i386/conf ) .
.Nm Config
places all output files in the directory
.Pa ../../compile/SYSTEM_NAME .
The output of
.Nm config
consists of a number of files, including
.Pa ioconf.c ,
a description
of what I/O devices are attached to the system;
.Pa Makefile ,
used by
.Xr make 1
in building the system;
header files,
definitions of
the number of various devices that will be compiled into the system;
swap configuration files,
definitions for
the disk areas to be used for swapping, the root file system,
argument processing, and system dumps.
.Pp
After running
.Nm config ,
it is necessary to run
.Dq Li make depend
in the directory where the new makefile
was created.
.Nm Config
prints a reminder of this when it completes.
.Pp
If any other error messages are produced by
.Nm config ,
the problems in the configuration file should be corrected and
.Nm config
should be run again.
Attempts to compile a system that had configuration errors
are likely to fail.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /sys/conf/xxx/Makefile.xxx -compact
.It Pa /sys/XXX/conf/Makefile.XXX
generic makefile for the
.Em XXX
architecture
.It Pa /sys/conf/files
list of common files system is built from
.It Pa /sys/XXX/conf/files.XXX
machine-specific files
for each architecture
.Em XXX
.It Pa /sys/XXX/conf/devices.XXX
name to major device mapping file
for each architecture
.Em XXX
.It Pa /sys/XXX/conf/files.ERNIE

system
