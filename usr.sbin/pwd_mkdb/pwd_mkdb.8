.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd_mkdb
.Nd generate the password databases
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwd_mkdb
.Op Fl c Ar cachesize
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl p
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Pwd_mkdb
creates
.Xr dbopen 3
style secure and insecure databases for the specified file.
These databases are then installed into
.Pa /etc/spwd.db
and
.Pa /etc/pwd.db
respectively.
The file is installed into
.Pa /etc/master.passwd .
The file must be in the correct format (see
.Xr passwd 5 ) .
It is important to note that the format used in this system is
different from the historic Version 7 style format.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar cachesize
Set the cache size for the database routines to 
.Ar cachesize
kilobytes.
.It Fl d
Causes
.Nm pwd_mkdb
to write all output files in the current working directory
(e.g.,
.Pa /etc/passwd
becomes
.Pa ./passwd ) .
This can be used to build a
.Pa pwd.db
file for an
anonymous ftp directory.  You should not run as root to build
the databases using this option because if you accidentally
forget the
.Fl d
option then it will overwrite your
.Pa /etc/master.passwd
file.  When creating the databases for an anonymous ftp directory be sure
that you do not install the
.Pa spwd.db
or
.Pa master.passwd
files; they are not needed for anonymous ftp and they contain
the encrypted passwords which you do not want to make available.
.It Fl p
Create a Version 7 style password file and install it into
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.El
.Pp
The two databases differ in that the secure version contains the user's 
encrypted password and the insecure version has an asterisk
.Pq Ql \&* .
.Pp
The databases are used by the C library password routines (see
.Xr getpwent 3 ) .
.Pp
The 
.Fl c
option is provided for performance tuning.  The default 
parameter (1024K) should provide reasonable performance on databases with 
3000 or fewer accounts.  Increasing the cache size can be of great 
benefit on files with large numbers of entries, but too much cache
can cause the machine to start paging and reduce performance.  If you
have a large site and need to change the value semi-permanently (so that
.Xr chpass 1
and
.Xr passwd 1
both use a larger cachesize)
you can use
.Xr bpatch 1
to change the
.Va defcache
value (in bytes) in the executable.
.Pp
.Nm Pwd_mkdb
exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /etc/pwd.db
The insecure password database file
.It Pa /etc/pwd.db.tmp
A temporary file
.It Pa /etc/spwd.db
The secure password database file
.It Pa /etc/spwd.db.tmp
A temporary file
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
The current password file
.It Pa /etc/passwd
A Version 7 format password file
.El
.Sh BUGS
Because of the necessity for atomic update of the password files,
.Nm pwd_mkdb
uses
.Xr rename 2
to install them.
This, however, requires that the file specified on the command line live
on the same file system as the
.Pa /etc
directory.
.Pp
There are the obvious races with multiple people running
.Nm pwd_mkdb
on different password files at the same time.
The front-ends to 
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8 :
.Xr chpass 1 ,
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.Xr vipw 8 ,
handle the locking necessary to avoid this problem.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Previous versions of the system had
.Nm mkpasswd ,
a program similar to
.Nm pwd_mkdb ,
which built
.Nm dbm
style databases for the password file but depended on the calling programs
to install them.
The program was renamed in order that previous users of the program
not be surprised by the changes in functionality.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chpass 1 ,
.Xr passwd 1 ,
.Xr db 3 ,
.Xr getpwent 3 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr vipw 8
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Pwd_mkdb
writes the temporary output files into the same filesystem as the
final files, this means you must have enough free space to do so
or it will fail.
