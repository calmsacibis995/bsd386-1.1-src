This file contains problems known to the authors that still need to be done.
We would appreciate if you could spare some of your time to look through
these topics and help us with some open questions. Most of the topics
pertain to specific architectures where we have no direct access or not
the time or expertise to currently track down the problem further.
If you don't know what we are talking about in the topics don't bother
with finding out - somebody else will probably solve that problem.

Before you try to send a solution to mills@udel.edu please check whether
this problem still exists in the distribution on louie.udel.edu.

Thank you for your help !

Open issues:

HPUX:
	- Time warp
	During the last few month disturbing reports about xntp setting
	preposterous times during periods of high load have been reported
	on HPUX 8 and 9. The theory is that the adjtimed message queue
	gets deleted. Symptoms are that xntp() complains about interrupted
	system calls in adjtime()-emulation and the time is set to some
	invalid date. Also the adjtimed seems to have problems. We could
	need some help here by an experienced HPUX guru.
	Files affected: adjtime/*

Apollo:
	- terminal affiliation
	Check whether thing are still correct in respect to breaking
	terminal affiliation - horrible stories are told in the code.
	File affected: xntpd/ntpd.c
