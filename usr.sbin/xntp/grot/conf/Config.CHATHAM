# Definitions for the library:
#
# You must define one of -DXNTP_BIG_ENDIAN, -DXNTP_LITTLE_ENDIAN
#	or -DXNTP_AUTO_ENDIAN depending on which way your machine's
#	bytes go for the benefit of the DES routine.  Most things
#	sold by DEC, the NS32x32 and the 80386 deserve a
#	-DXNTP_LITTLE_ENDIAN.  Most of the rest of the world does
#	it the other way.  If in doubt, pick one, compile
#	everything and run authstuff/authcert < authstuff/certdata.
#	If everything fails, do it the other way.
#
#	Under BSD, you may define -DXNTP_NETINET_ENDIAN to use
#	netinet/in.h to determine which of -DXNTP_BIG_ENDIAN and
#	XNTP_LITTLE_ENDIAN should be used.
#
LIBDEFS= -DWORDS_BIGENDIAN

RANLIB=		ranlib
#RANLIB=	: # ar does the work of ranlib under System V

#
# Definitions for programs:
# 
# If your compiler doesn't understand the declaration `signed char',
#       add -DNO_SIGNED_CHAR_DECL.  Your `char' data type had better be
#	signed.  If you don't know what the compiler knows, try it
#	without the flag.  If you get a syntax error on line 13 of
#	ntp.h, add it.  Note that `signed char' is an ANSIism.  Most
#	older, pcc-derived compilers will need this flag.
#
# If your library already has 's_char' defined, add -DS_CHAR_DEFINED.
#
# For SunOS 3.x, add -DSUN_3_3_STINKS (otherwise it will complain
#	about broadaddr and will hang if you run without a -d flag
#	on the command line.  I actually can't believe the latter
#	bug.  If it hangs on your system with the flag defined, peruse
#	xntpd/ntp_io.c for some rude comments about SunOS 3.5 and try it
#	the other way).  This flag affects xntpd only.
#
# For Ultrix 2.0, add -DULT_2_0_SUCKS.  This OS has the same hanging
#	bug as SunOS 3.5 (is this an original 4.2 bug?) and in addition
#	has some strangeness concerning signal masks.  Ultrix 2.3 doesn't
#	have these problems.  If you're running something in between
#	you're on your own.  This flag affects xntpd only.
#
# For SunOS 4.x, add -DDOSYNCTODR_SUCKS to include the code in ntp_util.c
#	that sets the battery clock at the same time that it updates
#	the driftfile. It does this by revving up the niceness, then
#	sets the time of day to the current time of day. Ordinarily,
#	you would need this only on non-networked machines.
#
# For some machines, settimeofday does not set the sub-second component
#       of the time correctly. For these machines add -DSETTIMEOFDAY_BROKEN.
#       If xntpd keeps STEPPING the clock by small amounts, then it is
#       possible that you are suffering from this problem.
#
# There are three ways to pry loose the kernel variables tick and tickadj
#	needed by ntp_unixclock.c.  One reads kmem and and is enabled
#	with -DREADKMEM.  One uses Sun's libkvm and is enabled with
#	-DUSELIBKVM. The last one uses builtin defaults and is enabled
#	with -DNOKMEM. Therefore, one of -DUSELIBKVM, -DREADKMEM or
#	-DNOKMEM must be defined. Suns and recent BSD should use
#	-DUSELIBKVM; others should use -DREADKMEM. If -DUSELIBKVM, use
#	the DAEMONLIBS below to get the kernel routines.
#
# If your gethostbyname() routine isn't based on the DNS resolver (and,
#	in particular, h_errno doesn't exist) add a -DNODNS.  There
#	doesn't seem to be a good way to detect this automatically which
#	works in all cases.  This flag affects xntpres only.
#
# Adding -DLOCK_PROCESS to the compilation flags will prevent
#	xntpd from being swapped out on systems where the plock(3) call
#	is available.
#
# The flag -DDEBUG includes some debugging code.
#
# The flag -DREFCLOCK causes the basic reference clock support to be
#	compiled into the daemon.  If you set this you will also want
#	to configure the particular clock drivers you want in the
#	CLOCKDEFS= line below.  This flag affects xntpd only.
#
# There is an occurance of a call to rindex() in the daemon.  You may
#	have to include a -Drindex=strrchr to get this to load right.
#
# To change the location of the configuration file, use a
#	-DCONFIG_FILE=\\"/local/etc/ntp.conf\\" or something similar.
#
# Under HP-UX, you must use either -Dhpux70 or -Dhpux80 as,
#	well as -DNOKMEM
#
# If your library doesn't include the vsprintf() routine, define
#	NEED_VSPRINTF.
#
# There are three ways to utilize external 1-pps signals. Define -DPPS to
#	include just the pps routine, such as used by the DCF77 reference clock
#	driver. Define -DPPSDEV ito include a serial device driver. This
#	requires a serial port and either a line discipline or STREAMS module.
#	Define -DPPSCD to include the driver and a special kernal hack
#	(for SunOS 4.1.1) that intercepts carrier-detect transitions
#	generated by the pps signal. Only one of these flags should be defined.

#  have a 680x0 type CPU and GNU-C, also choose -DFASTMD5
#

#
# Clock support definitions (these only make sense if -DREFCLOCK used):
#
# Define -DLOCAL_CLOCK to include local pseudo-clock support
#
# Define -DPST to include support for the PST 1020 WWV/H receiver.
#
# Define -DWWVB to include support for the Spectracom 8170 WWVB receiver.
#	Define -DWWVBPPS for PPS support via the WWVB receiver; also,
#	define -DPPSCD in the DEFS above. This requires the ppsclock
#	streams module under SunOS 4.2.
#
# Define -DCHU to include support for a driver to receive the CHU
#	timecode.  Note that to compile in CHU support you must
#	previously have installed the CHU serial line discipline in
#	the kernel of the machine you are doing the compile on.
#
# Define -DDCF to include support for the DCF77 receiver. This code
#	requires a special STREAMS module found in the kernel directory.
#	Define -DDCFPPS for PPS support via the DCF77 receiver; also,
#	devine -DPPS in the DEFS above.
#
# Define -DMX4200 to support a Magnavox 4200 GPS receiver. Define -DPPSCD
#	in the DEFS above for PPS support via this receiver. This requires
#	the ppsclock streams module under SunOS 4.2.	
#
# Define -DAS2201 to include support for the Austron 2201 GPS Timing
#	Receiver. Define -DPPSCD in the DEFS above for PPS support via this
#	receiver. This requires the ppsclock streams module under SunOS 4.2.
#
# Define -DGOES to support a Kinemetrics TrueTime 468-DC GOES receiver. This
#	driver may work with other True-Time products as well.
#
# Define -DOMEGA to support a Kinemetrics TrueTime OM-DC OMEGA receiver.
#
# Define -DTPRO to support a KSI/Odetics TPRO-S IRIG-B timecode reader. This
#	requires the Sun interface driver available from KSI.
#
# Define -DLEITCH to support a Leitch CSD 5300 Master Clock System Driver
#	for the HP 5061B Cesium Clock.

# For MIPS 4.3BSD or RISCos 4.0, include a -lmld to get the nlist() routine.
