Statistics processing scripts (README)

This directory contains a number of scripts for use with the filegen
facility. Those files ending in .awk are for the Unix awk utility, while
those ending in .sh are for the csh utility. Normally, the summary.sh
script is called from a cron job once per day. This script calls the
peer.sh script to process the peerstats file and append the summary
statistics to the peer_summary file. Then, it callse the loop.sh script
to process the loopstats file and append the summary statistics to the
loop_summary file. Finally, it calls the clock.sh script to process the
clockstats file and append the summary statistics to the clock_summary
file.

Each of the three shell scripts peer.sh, loop.sh and clock.sh invoke
one or more awk scripts to actually produce the data. This may result
in multiple scans of the same input file. The input file is deleted after
processing. In fact, the shell scripts will process all input files
found of the correct type in chronological order, deleting each one as
it is scanned, except the current day file.

The psummary.awk script can be used to scan the peer_summary file and
construct an historical reprise of the daily summaries. 

The file formats are documented in the README.stats file and in the
scripts themselves. Further detail on the radio clock ASCII timecode
formats and related data are in the README.timecode file.
